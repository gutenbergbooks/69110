  <p class="noindent">When not tending New York holdings, Guy Grand was generally, as he
    expressed it, “<em>on the go</em>.” He took cross-country trips by
    train: New York to Miami, Miami to Seattle—that sort of thing—always
    on a slow train, one that made frequent stops. Accommodation on these
    trains is limited, and though he did engage the best, Grand often had
    to be satisfied with a small compartment fitted with scarcely more
    than the essentials of comfort. But he accepted this cheerfully; and
    so today, on a summer afternoon at precisely 2:05, it was with buoyant
    step (considering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span> his girth—for, at fifty-three now, he was rather
    stout) that he climbed aboard the first Pullman of the <cite>Portland
    Plougher</cite>, found his compartment, and began the pleasant routine of
    settling in for the long slow journey to New York. As was his habit, he
    immediately rang the porter to bring round a large bottle of Campari
    and a bottle of finely iced water; then he sat down at his desk to
    write business letters.</p>

  <p>It was known that for any personal service Grand was inclined to tip
    generously, and because of this there were usually three or four
    porters loitering in the corridor nearby. They kept a sharp eye on the
    compartment door, in case Grand should signal some need or other; and,
    as the train pulled out of the station, they could hear him moving
    about inside, humming to himself, and shuffling papers to and fro on
    his desk. Before the train made its first stop, however, they would
    have to scurry, for Grand’s orders were that the porters should not be
    seen when he came out of his compartment; and he did come out, at every stop.</p>

  <p>At the first of these stops, which was not long in occurring, Grand
    went quickly to the adjoining day coach and took a seat by the window.
    There he was able to lean out and observe the activity on the platform;
    he attracted little attention himself, resembling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span> as he did, with his
    pleasant red face, any honest farmer.</p>

  <p>From the train window one could see over and beyond the station the
    rest of the small New England town—motionless now in the summer
    afternoon, like a toy mausoleum—while all that seemed to live within
    the town was being skillfully whipped underground and funneled up again
    in swift urgency onto the station platform, where small square cartons
    were unloaded from a central car.</p>

  <p>But amidst the confusion and haste on the platform there was one
    recognizable figure; this was the man who sold hotdogs from a box he
    carried strapped to his neck.</p>

  <p>“They’re <em>red hot</em>!” he cried repeatedly, walking up and down
    parallel to the train and only a foot from it—while Grand, after a
    minute of general observation, focused all his attention on this
    person; and then, at exactly one minute before departure, he began his
    case with the hotdog-man.</p>

  <p>“Red hot!” he shouted; and when the man reached the window, Grand eyed
    him shrewdly for a second, squinting, as though perhaps appraising his
    character, before asking, tight-lipped:</p>

  <p>“<em>How much?</em>”</p>

  <p>“Twenty cents,” the hotdog-man said hurriedly—for the train was about
    to pull out—“... mustard and relish, they’re red hot!”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

  <p>“Done!” said Grand with a sober nod, and as the train actually began to
    move forward and the hotdog-man to walk rapidly in keeping abreast of
    the window, Guy Grand leaned out and handed him a five-hundred-dollar
    bill.</p>

  <p>“Break this?” he asked tersely.</p>

  <p>The hotdog-man, in trying to utilize all their remaining time, passed
    the hotdog to Grand and reached into his change pocket before having
    looked carefully at the bill—so that by the time he made out its
    denomination, he was running almost full tilt, grimacing oddly and
    shaking his head, trying to return the bill with one hand and recover
    the hotdog with the other. During their final second together, with the
    hotdog-man’s last overwhelming effort to reach his outstretched hand,
    Grand reached into his own coat pocket and took out a colorful plastic
    animal mask—today it was that of <em>pig</em>—which he quickly donned
    before beginning to gorge the hotdog through the mouth of the mask,
    at the same time reaching out frantically for the bill, yet managing
    somehow to keep it just beyond his fingers’ grasp, and continuing with
    this while the distance between them lengthened, hopelessly, until at
    last the hotdog-man stood exhausted on the end of the platform, still
    holding the five hundred, and staring after the vanishing train.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

  <p>When Grand finally drew himself back from the window and doffed his
    pig mask, it was to face a middle-aged woman across the aisle who was
    twisted halfway around in her seat, observing Grand with a curiosity so
    intense that the instant of their eyes actually meeting did not seem to
    register with her. Then she coughed and glanced away—but irresistibly
    back again, as Guy Grand rose, all smiles, to leave the day coach,
    giving the woman a wink of affectionate conspiracy as he did.</p>

  <p>“Just having a laugh with that hot-frank vender,” he explained. “... no
    real harm done, surely.”</p>

  <p>He returned to his compartment then, where he sat at the desk sipping
    his Campari—a drink the color of raspberries, but bitter as gall—and
    speculating about the possible reactions of the hotdog-man.</p>

  <p>Outside the compartment, even at the far end of the corridor, the idle
    porters could often hear his odd chortle as he stirred about inside.</p>

  <p>By the time the train reached New York, Guy Grand had gone through this
    little performance four or five times, curious fellow.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Out of the gray granite morass of Wall Street rises one building like
    a heron of fire, soaring up in blue-white astonishment—<cite>Number 18
    Wall</cite>—a rocket of glass and blinding copper. It is the <cite>Grand
    Investment Building</cite>, perhaps the most contemporary business
    structure in our country, known in circles of high finance simply as
    <cite>Grand’s</cite>.</p>

  <p>Offices of <cite>Grand’s</cite> are occupied by companies which deal in
    <em>mutual funds</em>—giant and fantastic corporations whose policies
    define the shape of nations.</p>

  <p>August Guy Grand himself was a billionaire. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span> had 180 millions cash
    deposit in New York banks, and this ready capital was of course but a
    part of his gross holdings.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, Grand’s associates, wealthy men themselves, saw
    nothing extraordinary about him; a reticent man of simple tastes, they
    thought, a man who had inherited most of his money and had preserved
    it through large safe investments in steel, rubber, and oil. What his
    associates managed to see in Grand was usually a reflection of their
    own dullness: a club member, a dinner guest, a possibility, a threat—a
    man whose holdings represented a prospect and a danger. But this was
    to do injustice to Grand’s private life, because his private life was
    atypical. For one thing, he was the last of the big spenders; and for
    another, he had a very unusual attitude towards <em>people</em>—he spent
    about ten million a year in, as he expressed it himself, “<em>making it
    hot for them</em>.”</p>

  <div class="center">*<span class="col3">*</span>
    <span class="col3">*</span><span class="col3">*</span><span class="col3">*</span></div>

  <p class="noindent">At fifty-three, Grand had a thick trunk and a large balding
    bullet-head; his face was quite pink, so that in certain half-lights he
    looked like a fat radish-man—though not displeasingly so, for he always
    sported well-cut clothes and, near the throat, a diamond the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span> size of a
    nickel ... a diamond now that caught the late afternoon sun in a soft
    spangle of burning color when Guy stepped through the soundless doors
    of <cite>Grand’s</cite> and into the blue haze of the almost empty street,
    past the huge doorman appearing larger than life in gigantic livery, he
    who touched his cap with quick but easy reverence.</p>

  <p>“Cab, Mr. Grand?”</p>

  <p>“Thank you no, Jason,” said Guy, “I have the car today.” And with a
    pleasant smile for the man, he turned adroitly on his heel, north
    towards Worth Street.</p>

  <p>Guy Grand’s gait was brisk indeed—small sharp steps, rising on the
    toes. It was the gait of a man who appears to be snapping his fingers
    as he walks.</p>

  <p>Half a block on he reached the car, though he seemed to have a
    momentary difficulty in recognizing it; beneath the windshield wiper
    lay a big parking ticket, which Grand slowly withdrew, regarding it
    curiously.</p>

  <p>“Looks like you’ve got a <em>ticket</em>, bub!” said a voice somewhere
    behind him.</p>

  <p>Out of the corner of his eye Grand perceived the man, in a dark summer
    suit, leaning idly against the side of the building nearest the car.
    There was something terse and smug in the tone of his remark, a sort of
    nasal piousness.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

  <p>“Yes, so it seems,” mused Grand, without looking up, continuing to
    study the ticket in his hand. “How much will you eat it for?” he asked
    then, raising a piercing smile at the man.</p>

  <p>“How’s that, mister?” demanded the latter with a nasty frown, pushing
    himself forward a bit from the building.</p>

  <p>Grand cleared his throat and slowly took out his wallet—a long slender
    wallet of such fine leather it would have been limp as silk, had it not
    been so chock-full of thousands.</p>

  <p>“I asked what would you take to <em>eat</em> it? You know....” Wide-eyed,
    he made a great chewing motion with his mouth, holding the ticket up
    near it.</p>

  <p>The man, glaring, took a tentative step forward.</p>

  <p>“Say, I don’t <em>get</em> you, mister!”</p>

  <p>“Well,” drawled Grand, chuckling down at his fat wallet, browsing about
    in it, “simple enough really....” And he took out a few thousand.
    “<em>I</em> have this ticket, as you know, and I was just wondering
    if you would care to <em>eat</em> it, for, say”—a quick glance to
    ascertain—“six thousand dollars?”</p>

  <p>“What do you mean, ‘<em>eat it</em>’?” demanded the dark-suited man in a
    kind of a snarl. “Say, what’re you anyway, bub, a <em>wise</em>-guy?”</p>

  <p>“‘<em>Wise</em>-guy’ or ‘<em>grand</em> guy’—call me anything you like ...
    as long as you don’t call me ‘<em>late-for-chow!</em>’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span> Eh? Ho-ho.” Grand
    rounded it off with a jolly chortle, but was quick to add, unsmiling,
    “How ’bout it, pal—got a taste for the easy green?”</p>

  <p>The man, who now appeared to be openly angry, took another step forward.</p>

  <p>“<em>Listen</em>, mister ...” he began in a threatening tone, half
    clenching his fists.</p>

  <p>“I think I should warn you,” said Grand quietly, raising one hand to
    his breast, “that I am armed.”</p>

  <p>“<em>Huh?</em>” The man seemed momentarily dumfounded, staring down
    in dull rage at the six bills in Grand’s hand; then he partially
    recovered, and cocking his head to one side, regarded Grand narrowly,
    in an attempt at shrewd skepticism, still heavily flavored with
    indignation.</p>

  <p>“Just who do you think you <em>are</em>, Mister! Just what is your
    <em>game</em>?”</p>

  <p>“Grand’s the name, easy-green’s the game,” said Guy with a twinkle.
    “Play along?” He brusquely flicked the corners of the six crisp bills,
    and they crackled with a brittle, compelling sound.</p>

  <p>“<em>Listen</em> ...” muttered the man, tight-lipped, flexing his fingers
    and exhaling several times in angry exasperation, “... are <em>you</em>
    trying ... are you trying to tell ME that you’ll give <em>six thousand
    dollars</em> ... to ... to EAT that”—he pointed stiffly at the ticket in
    Guy’s hand—“to <em>eat</em> that TICKET?!?”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

  <p>“That’s about the size of it,” said Grand; he glanced at his watch.
    “It’s what you might call a ‘limited offer’—expiring in, let’s say,
    <em>one minute</em>.”</p>

  <p>“Listen, mister,” said the man between clenched teeth, “if this is a
    gag, <em>so help me</em>....” He shook his head to show how serious he
    was.</p>

  <p>“No threats,” Guy cautioned, “or I’ll shoot you in the temple—well,
    what say? Forty-eight seconds remaining.”</p>

  <p>“Let’s <em>see</em> that goddamn money!” exclaimed the man, quite beside
    himself now, grabbing at the bills.</p>

  <p>Grand allowed him to examine them as he continued to regard his watch.
    “Thirty-nine seconds remaining,” he announced solemnly. “Shall I start
    the <em>big count down</em>?”</p>

  <p>Without waiting for the latter’s reply, he stepped back and,
    cupping his hands like a megaphone, began dramatically intoning,
    “<em>Twenty-eight</em> ... <em>twenty-seven</em> ... <em>twenty-six</em> ...”
    while the man made several wildly gesticulated and incoherent remarks
    before seizing the ticket, ripping off a quarter of it with his teeth
    and beginning to chew, eyes blazing.</p>

  <p>“<em>Stout fellow!</em>” cried Grand warmly, breaking off the count down
    to step forward and give the chap a hearty clap on the shoulder and
    hand him the six thousand.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

  <p>“You needn’t actually eat the ticket,” he explained. “I was just
    curious to see if you had your price.” He gave a wink and a tolerant
    chuckle. “Most of us have, I suppose. Eh? Ho-ho.”</p>

  <p>And with a grand wave of his hand, he stepped inside his car and sped
    away, leaving the man in the dark summer suit standing on the sidewalk
    staring after him, fairly agog.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Grand drove leisurely up the East River Drive—to a large and fine old
    house in the Sixties, where he lived with his two elderly aunts, Agnes
    and Esther Edwards.</p>

  <p>He found them in the drawing room when he arrived.</p>

  <p>“There you are, Guy!” said Agnes Edwards with tart affection, who at
    eighty-six was a year senior to Esther and held the initiative in most
    things between them.</p>

  <p>“Guy, Guy, Guy,” exclaimed Esther happily in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span> turn, with a really
    beautiful pink smile for him—but she insisted then upon raising her
    teacup, so that all to be seen now was her brow, softly clouded, as
    ever, in maternal concern for the boy. Both women were terribly,
    chronically, troubled that Guy, at fifty-three, was unmarried—though
    perhaps each, in her way, would have fought against it.</p>

  <p>Guy beamed at them from the doorway, then crossed to kiss both before
    going to his big sofa-chair by the window where he always sat.</p>

  <p>“We’re just having tea, darling—do!” insisted his Aunt Agnes with
    brittle passion, flourishing her little silver service bell in a smart
    tinkle and presenting her half-upturned face for his kiss—as though to
    receive it perfunctorily, but with eyelids closed and tremoring, one
    noticed, and a second very thin hand which, as in reflex, started to
    rise towards their faces, wavering up, clenched white as the lace at
    her wrists.</p>

  <p>“Guy, Guy, Guy,” cried Esther again, sharpening her own gaiety as she
    set her cup down—quickly enough, but with a care that gave her away.</p>

  <p>“You will take tea, won’t you, my Guy!” said Agnes, and she conveyed it
    in a glance to the maid who’d appeared.</p>

  <p>“Love some,” said Guy Grand, giving his aunts such a smile of fanatic
    brightness that they both squirmed a bit. He was in good spirits now
    after his trip—but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span> soon enough, as the women could well attest, he
    would fall away from them, lapse into mystery behind his great gray
    <cite>Financial Times</cite> and <cite>Wall Street Journal</cite> for hours on end:
    distrait, they thought; never speaking, certainly; answering, yes—but
    most often in an odd and distant tone that told them nothing, nothing.</p>

  <div class="center">*<span class="col3">*</span>
    <span class="col3">*</span><span class="col3">*</span><span class="col3">*</span></div>

  <p class="noindent">“Guy ...” Agnes Edwards began, turning her cup in her hand and forcing
    one of the warm playful frowns used by the extremely rich to show the
    degree of seriousness felt.</p>

  <p>“Yes, Aunt Agnes,” said Guy unnecessarily, even brightly, actually
    coming forward a bit on his chair, not turning his own cup, but
    fingering it, politely nervous.</p>

  <p>“Guy ... you <em>know</em> Clemence’s young man. Well, I <em>think</em>
    they want to get <em>married</em>! and ... oh I don’t know, I was just
    wondering if we couldn’t <em>help</em>. Naturally, I haven’t said a
    thing to her about it—I wouldn’t dare, of course ... but then what’s
    <em>your</em> feeling on it, Guy? Surely there’s something we can do,
    don’t you agree?”</p>

  <p>Guy Grand could have no notion what she was talking about, except that
    it was undoubtedly a question<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span> of money; but he spoke darkly enough to
    suggest that he was weighing his words with care.</p>

  <p>“Why I should think so, yes.”</p>

  <p>Agnes Edwards beamed and raised her cup in a gesture both coy and smug,
    then the two women glanced at each other, smiling prettily, almost
    lifting their brows—whatever it was, it was a certain gain all around.</p>

  <div class="center">*<span class="col3">*</span>
    <span class="col3">*</span><span class="col3">*</span><span class="col3">*</span></div>

  <p class="noindent">Grand’s own idea of what he was doing—“making it hot for people”—had
    formed crudely, literally, and almost as an afterthought, when, early
    one summer morning in 1938, just about the time the Spanish Civil War
    was ending, he flew out to Chicago and, within an hour of arrival,
    purchased a property on one of the busiest corners of the Loop. He had
    the modern two-story structure torn down and the debris cleared off
    that day—that very morning, in fact—by a demolition crew of fifty men
    and machines; and then he directed the six carpenters, who had been on
    stand-by since early morning, when they had thrown up a plank barrier
    at the sidewalk, to construct the wooden forms for a concrete vat
    of the following proportions: fifteen feet square, five feet deep.
    This construction was done in an hour and a half, and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span> seemed that
    the work, except for pouring the concrete, was ended; in fact the
    carpenters had put on their street clothes and were ready to leave
    when, after a moment of reflection, Grand assembled them with a smart
    order to take down this present structure, and to rebuild it, but on
    a two-foot elevation—giving clearance beneath, as he explained to the
    foreman, to allow for the installation of a heating apparatus there.</p>

  <p>“<em>That’ll make it hot for them</em>,” he said—but he wasn’t speaking
    to the foreman then, nor apparently to anyone else.</p>

  <p>It was mid-afternoon, and collecting from the flux of the swollen
    summer street were the spectators, who hung in bunches at the sturdy
    barrier, gatherings in constant change, impressed in turn by the way
    the great man from the East snapped his commands, expensively dressed
    as he was, shirt turned back at the cuff.</p>

  <p>And when the work was going ahead correctly, Grand might give the crowd
    a moment of surveillance from where he stood in the center of the lot,
    finally addressing them, hands cupped to his mouth as if he had to
    shout—though, actually, they were only a few yards away.</p>

  <p>“<em>Tomorrow</em> ...” he would say, “... <em>back ... tomorrow! Now ...
      getting ... it ... ready!</em>”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

  <p>When an occasional wiseacre could get his attention and attempt some
    joke as to what was going on there beyond the barrier, Grand Guy Grand
    would smile wearily and shake a scolding finger at him.</p>

  <p>“<em>Now ... getting ... it ... ready</em>,” he would shout slowly, or
    something else equally irrelevant to the wiseacre’s jibe; but no one
    took offense, either because of not understanding or else because of
    the dignity and bearing of the man, and the big diamond he wore at his
    throat.</p>

  <p>Another contractor, three workers, a truck of sand and gravel, and
    six sacks of quick-drying cement arrived at the working site at two
    o’clock, but were forced to wait until the new forms were complete.
    Then a sheet of metal was lowered into place and the concrete was
    poured into the forms. Under Grand’s spirited command, it was all so
    speedily done that well before dusk the work was ended, including the
    installation of a great gas burner there, star-shaped with a thousand
    dark jets, like a giant upturned squid stretched beneath the structure.
    It was apparent now that when the board forms were removed, the whole
    would resemble a kind of white stone bath, set on four short columns,
    with a heating apparatus beneath, and small ramps leading up the vat on
    each of its sides.</p>

  <p>Before dinner Guy Grand completed arrangements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span> begun earlier in the
    day with the Chicago stockyards: these provided for the delivery of
    three hundred cubic feet of manure, a hundred gallons of urine, and
    fifty gallons of blood, to an address in the suburbs. Grand met them
    there and had the whole stinking mess transferred to a covered dump
    truck he had purchased that morning. These arrangements cost Grand a
    pretty penny, because the stockyards do not ordinarily conserve or sell
    urine, so that it had to be specially collected.</p>

  <p>After securing the truck’s cover, Grand climbed into the cab, drove
    back towards the stockyards and parked the truck there, where the
    stench of it would be less noticeable.</p>

  <p>Then he took a taxi into town, to the near North Side and had a quiet
    dinner at the Drake.</p>

  <p>At nine o’clock, while it was still light, he returned to the working
    site, where he was met by some of the crew, and saw to the removal
    of the board forms and the barrier. He inspected the vat, and the
    burner below—which he tested and found in good working order. Then he
    dismissed the crew and went back to his hotel.</p>

  <p>He sat at his desk writing business letters until his thin gold
    wrist-clock sounded three <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> Exactly then he put away his
    writing things, freshened himself up, and, just before leaving the
    room, paused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span> near the door and collected a big leather brief case, a
    gas mask, a wooden paddle, a bucket of black paint, and an old, stiff
    paintbrush. He went downstairs and took a cab out to the place where
    he had parked the dump truck. Leaving the cab, he got into the truck
    and drove back to the working site. There he backed the truck carefully
    up one of the ramps and then emptied all that muck into the vat. The
    stench was nearly overpowering, and Grand, as soon as he had parked
    the truck and gotten out of it, was quick to don the gas mask he had
    brought.</p>

  <p>Stepping up one of the ramps, he squatted on the parapet of the vat and
    opened the brief case, out of which he began taking, a handful at a
    time, and dropping into the vat, ten thousand one-hundred-dollar bills,
    slowly stirring them in with his wooden paddle.</p>

  <p>And he was in this attitude, squatting at the edge of the vat, gas mask
    covering his face, stirring with his paddle and dumping bills into
    the muck, the work only half begun, when a passing police patrol car
    pulled up to investigate the activity and, above all, the stench. But
    before the officers could properly take account, Grand had closed the
    brief case, doffed his mask, given them five thousand dollars each, and
    demanded to be taken at once to their precinct captain. After a few
    hushed words between them, and a shrugging of shoulders, they agreed.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>

  <p>At the station, Grand spoke privately with the captain, showing him
    several business cards and explaining that it was all a harmless
    promotion stunt for a new product.</p>

  <p>“Naturally my firm is eager to coöperate with the authorities,” he
    said, and handed the captain twenty-five thousand.</p>

  <p>And so it was finally agreed that Grand might return to the site and
    proceed, as long as whatever he was doing did not involve criminal
    violence within the precinct. Moreover, while the captain could make no
    definite promise about it, he was attentive enough to Grand’s proposal
    of an additional fifty thousand on the following noon if the police
    would be kept away from the site for a few hours that morning.</p>

  <p>“Think it over,” said Grand pleasantly. “Better sleep on it, eh?”</p>

  <p>Back at the site, Grand Guy donned his mask again, and dumped the
    remaining contents of the brief case into the vat. Then he stepped
    down, opened the can of paint, gave it good stirring, and finally,
    using his left hand so that what resulted looked childish or
    illiterate, he scrawled across the vat FREE $ HERE in big black letters
    on the sides facing the street.</p>

  <p>He climbed up for a final check on the work. Of the bills in the muck,
    the corners, edges, and denomination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span> figures of about five hundred
    were visible. After a moment he stepped down and, half crouching
    beneath the vat, took off his mask and saw to his burners. He did a
    short terse count down and turned the valve full open; then he removed
    the handle so that it could not easily be interfered with. As he
    touched off the match, the thousand flames sprang up, all blue light,
    and broke back doubling on the metal plate, and on the wet concrete—a
    color of sand in summer moonlight: one of those chosen instants, lost
    to childhood, damp places in reflection, surface of cement under
    the earth, the beautifully cool buried places ... the stench became
    unbearable; he stood and quickly donned his mask, turned away from the
    site and walked across the street where he paused at the corner and
    surveyed the whole. Already in the pale eastern light, the moronic
    scrawl, FREE $ HERE, loomed with convincing force, while below the
    thousand flames beat up, blue-white and strangely urgent for this hour
    of morning on a downtown corner of Chicago.</p>

  <p>“Say ...” mused Grand, half-aloud, “<em>that’ll</em> make it hot for them
    all right!” And he leaped into the big dump truck and drove like the
    wind back to his hotel. At dawn he caught the plane for New York.</p>

  <p>The commotion that occurred a few hours later on that busy corner of
    the Loop in downtown Chicago<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span> was the first and, in a sense perhaps,
    the most deliberately literal of such projects eventually to be
    linked with the name of “Grand Guy” Guy Grand, provoking the wrath
    of the public press against him, and finally earning him the label,
    “Eccentric” and again towards the end, “Crackpot.”</p>

  <p class="noindent">“Is Clemence a person?” asked Guy, taking a bit of sweet biscuit now,
    popping it into his mouth.</p>

  <p>Aunt Esther raised her hand to conceal a shaming twitter, and Aunt
    Agnes feigned impatience.</p>

  <p>“Guy, great silly!” said Agnes. “Really!” Though after a moment she
    softened, to continue:</p>

  <p>“Clemence is the new <em>maid</em>! She’s a Catholic girl, Guy—<em>and</em>
    a very nice one, if I may say so. She’s marrying this Jewish boy,
    Sol—how they’ll manage I’m sure I don’t know—I talked to them both,
    I told them that we were Protestants, had always been Protestants,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
    and always <em>would</em> be Protestants—but that I didn’t mind! Not
    in the least! ‘Freedom of worship and creed!’ I said. It’s always
    been a principle of <em>my</em> religion. Not so insistent and pushy as
    <em>some</em> I could name! I didn’t tell them <em>that</em>, of course,
    but there you are. Well, <em>she</em> wants a honeymoon in <em>Italy</em>,
    and a visit to the Pope, which I think is terribly sweet—and <em>he</em>
    wants to go to <em>his</em> place in the East, wherever it is; Israel,
    isn’t it? Oh, I don’t say it badly. They’re <em>very</em> nice, Guy—both
    of them as gentle and polite as you please, and ... well, they’ve
    enough money for <em>one</em> of the trips, you see, but <em>not</em> for
    both. I wish we could help them, Guy. I think it would be nice if they
    could go to <em>both</em> of their places, don’t you agree? You remember
    how much I enjoyed Calvin’s chair in Geneva! Of course it isn’t the
    same, but it <em>would</em> be sweet. What’s your feeling on it, Guy?”</p>

  <p>“But Guy has always been <em>eager</em> to help in such matters,” Esther
    broke in warmly.</p>

  <p>“Thank you, Aunt Esther,” said Guy with soft humility, “I do like to
    think that the record speaks for itself.”</p>

  <div class="center">*<span class="col3">*</span>
    <span class="col3">*</span><span class="col3">*</span><span class="col3">*</span></div>

  <p class="noindent">Guy Grand had owned a newspaper for a while—one of Boston’s popular
    dailies, with a circulation of 900,000.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span> When Grand assumed control,
    there was, at first, no change in the paper’s format, nor in its
    apparently high journalistic standards, as Grand stayed on in New York
    on the periphery of the paper’s operations, where he would remain, he
    said, until he “could get the feel of things.”</p>

  <p>During the second month, however, French words began to crop up
    unaccountably in news of local interest:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">Boston, Mar. 27 (AP)—Howard Jones, vingt-huit ans, convicted on
      three counts of larceny here, was sentenced this morning to 20–26
      months in Folsom State Prison, Judge Grath of 17th Circuit Court of
      Appeals announced aujourd’hui.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Working then through a succession of editors, proofreaders, and
    linotype operators, Grand gradually put forward the policy of
    misspelling the names of cities, islands, and proper nouns in
    general—or else having them appear in a foreign language:</p>

  <div class="center">YANKS HIT PARIGI<br>
    MOP-UP AT TERWEEWEE</div>

  <p>During the war, when geographic names were given daily prominence in
    the headlines, these distortions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span> served to antagonize the reader and
    to obscure the facts.</p>

  <p>The circulation of the paper fell off sharply, and after three months
    it was down to something less than one-twentieth of what it had
    been when Grand took over. At this point a major policy change was
    announced. Henceforth the newspaper would not carry comics, editorials,
    feature stories, reviews, or advertising, and would present only
    the factual news in a straightforward manner. It was called <cite>The
    Facts</cite>, and Grand spent the ransom of a dozen queens in getting at
    the facts of the news, or at least a great many of them, which he had
    printed then in simple sentences. The issues of the first two days or
    so enjoyed a fair sale, but the contents on the whole appeared to be
    so incredible or so irrelevant that by the end of the week demand was
    lower than at any previous phase of the paper’s existence. During the
    third week, the paper had no sale at all to speak of, and was simply
    given away; or, refused by the distributors, it was left in stacks on
    the street corners each morning, about two million copies a day. In the
    beginning people were amused by the sight of so many newspapers lying
    around unread; but when it continued, they became annoyed. Something
    funny was going on—<em>Communist? Atheist? Homosexual? Catholic?
    Monopoly? Corruption? Protestant? Insane? Negro?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span> Jewish? Puerto
    Rican? POETRY?</em> The city was filthy. It was easy for people to talk
    about <cite>The Facts</cite> in terms of litter and debris. Speeches were
    made, letters written, yet the issue was vague. The editor of <cite>The
    Facts</cite> received insulting letters by the bagful. Grand sat tight
    for a week, then he gave the paper over exclusively to printing these
    letters; and its name was changed again—<cite>Opinions</cite>.</p>

  <p>These printed letters reflected such angry divergence of thought and
    belief that what resulted was sharp dissension throughout the city.
    Group antagonism ran high. The paper was widely read and there were
    incidents of violence. Movements began.</p>

  <div class="center">*<span class="col3">*</span>
    <span class="col3">*</span><span class="col3">*</span><span class="col3">*</span></div>

  <p class="noindent">At about two <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> on June 7th, crowds started to gather in
    Lexington Square near the center of the city. The <em>Jewish</em>,
    <em>Atheist</em>, <em>Negro</em>, <em>Labor</em>, <em>Homosexual</em>, and
    <em>Intellectual</em> groups were on one side—the <em>Protestant</em> and
    <em>American Legion</em> on the other. The balance of power, or so it
    seemed, lay with the doughty <em>Catholic</em> group.</p>

  <p>It was fair and windless that day in Boston, and while the groups
    and the groups-within-groups bickered and jockeyed in the center of
    Lexington Square, Guy Grand brought off a <em>tour de force</em>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
    Hovering just overhead, in a radio-equipped helicopter, he directed
    the maneuver of a six-plane squadron of skywriters, much higher, in
    spelling out the mile-long smoke-letter words: F**K YOU ... and this
    was immediately followed by a veritable host of outlandish epithets,
    formulated as insults on the level of group Gestalt: Protestants are
    assholes ... Jews are full of crap ... Catholics are shitty ... and so
    on, <em>ad nauseum</em> actually.</p>

  <p>It set the crowd below hopping mad. Grand Guy Grand dropped to about
    a hundred feet, where he canted the plane towards them and opened the
    door to peer out and observe. The crowd, associating the low-flying
    helicopter with the outrageous skywriting going on above, started
    shouting obscenities and shaking their fists.</p>

  <p>“You rotten Mick!”</p>

  <p>“You dirty Yid!”</p>

  <p>“You black bastard!”</p>

  <p>That was how the fighting began.</p>

  <p>During the Lexington Square Riots, Grand set his plane down to
    twenty-five feet, where he cruised around, leaning out the door,
    expressionless, shouting in loud, slow intonation:</p>

  <p>“WHAT’S ... UP? WHAT’S ... UP?”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>

  <div class="center">*<span class="col3">*</span>
    <span class="col3">*</span><span class="col3">*</span><span class="col3">*</span></div>

  <p class="noindent">By four o’clock the square was in shambles and all Boston on the brink
    of eruption. The National Guard had to be brought into the city and
    martial law obtained. It was thirty-six hours before order was fully
    restored.</p>

  <p>The press made capital of the affair. Investigations were demanded. Guy
    Grand had paid off some big men in order to carry forward the project,
    but this was more than they had bargained for. Back in New York it cost
    him two million to keep clear.</p>

  <hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
    <h2 class="nobreak" id="V">V</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">“Yes, I see,” said Guy, clearing his throat, looking with concern at
    the piece of sweet biscuit in his hand, “... certainly. Why don’t you
    ... well, you know, find out how much they need, make out a check, and....”</p>

  <p>Aunt Esther covertly twittered again, her eyes bright above the very
    white hand that hid her mouth, and Agnes turned her own face sharply
    away in mock exasperation with the boy.</p>

  <p>“Not <em>give</em> them the money, Guy!” Agnes exclaimed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span> “They
    wouldn’t <em>hear</em> of it, of course—the young man, <em>Sol</em>,
    especially. Surely you know how <em>proud</em> those people are ...
    a defensive-mechanism, I suppose; but there you are, even so!
    <em>No</em>—what I had in mind was to tell them of a <em>stock</em> to buy,
    you see.”</p>

  <p>“Right,” said Guy crisply, “then they would take one of the trips
    later, that the idea? But, hold on—if they spend all their money on the
    one trip, how can they buy into the stock in question?”</p>

  <p>“Guy!” said his aunt in a voice of ice and pain.</p>

  <p>“I’m afraid I don’t follow,” said Grand with perfect candor.</p>

  <p>Aunt Esther took refuge behind her kerchief, into her ceaseless
    giggling.</p>

  <p>“<em>I mean make it go up and down!</em>” cried Agnes crossly. “Or rather
    <em>down</em> first, then <em>up</em>.”</p>

  <p>She regarded him narrowly for a moment, her thinness stretching upwards
    like an angry swan, suspecting perhaps that he was being deliberately
    obtuse.</p>

  <p>“A perfect babe in the woods!” she said. “How you manage to hold your
    own at conference table I’m sure I couldn’t imagine!”</p>

  <p>“Sorry,” said Grand, unsmiling, following through with the youthful
    gesture of slightly ducking his head for a sip of tea.</p>

  <p>Of course it was all largely an act between them.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>

  <p>“Name one good stock in which you hold ten thousand shares,” said Agnes
    sharply.</p>

  <p>“One good stock ...” repeated Guy Grand, his great brow clouding.</p>

  <p>“... that begins with an ‘A’,” said Aunt Esther.</p>

  <p>“That begins with an ‘A’?” said Grand, almost incredulous, yet as
    willing as a good-natured child at play.</p>

  <p>“Esther!” cried Agnes.</p>

  <p>“Well, do you mean <em>exactly</em> ten thousand, or <em>at least</em> ten
    thousand?” asked Guy.</p>

  <p>“At least ten thousand,” said Agnes. “And it <em>needn’t</em>,” she
    added, with a straight look to her sister, “begin with an ‘A’!”</p>

  <p>“Hmm. Well, how about ‘Abercrombie and Adams’?” said Grand tentatively,
    “there’s a fairly sound—”</p>

  <p>“Good,” said Aunt Agnes. “Now then, what if you sold all your shares of
    that? What would happen to the price of it?”</p>

  <p>“Take a nasty drop,” said Grand, with a scowl at the thought of it.
    “Might cause a run.”</p>

  <p>“There you are then!” cried Agnes. “And Clemence’s young man
    <em>buys</em>—when the price is down, <em>he buys</em>, you see—then the
    <em>next</em> day, you buy back what you sold! I should think it would go
    up again when you buy back what you sold, wouldn’t it?”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

  <p>“Might and might not,” said Grand, somewhat coldly.</p>

  <p>“<em>Well</em>,” said Agnes, with a terrible hauteur, “you can just
    <em>keep</em> buying until it does!” Then she continued, in softer
    tones, to show her ultimate reasonableness: “Surely you can, Guy. And
    then, you see, when it’s up again, Clemence and her young man will
    <em>sell</em>.”</p>

  <p>“Yes,” said Grand with a certain quiet dignity, “but you know, it
    might not look good, that sort of thing, with the Federal Securities
    Commission.”</p>

  <p>Agnes’s lips were so closely compressed now that they resembled a
    turtle’s mouth.</p>

  <p>“Might not <em>look</em>,” she repeated, making it hollow, her eyes
    widening as though she had lifted a desert rock and seen what was
    beneath it. “<em>Well</em>,” she said with unnerving softness, taking
    a sip of tea to brace herself and even turning to draw on her sister
    with a look of dark significance, “... if all you’re concerned with
    is <em>appearance</em>—then perhaps you aren’t the person I thought you
    were, after all.” And she poured herself another cup.</p>

  <p>Grand was stricken with a mild fit of coughing. “Yes,” he was able to
    say at last, “... yes, I see your point, of course. Does bear some
    thinking through though, I must say.”</p>

  <p>His aunt, momentarily aghast, had just started to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span> speak again, when
    the maid stepped inside the door to announce the arrival of Miss Ginger
    Horton—an extremely fat lady, who entered the room then, wearing an
    immense trapeze sunsuit and carrying her Pekinese.</p>

  <p>“<em>Guy!</em>” she cried, extending her hand, as he, rising, came
    forward. “How <em>too</em> good to see you!</p>

  <p>“Say hello to <em>Guy</em>, my Bitsy!” she shrieked gaily to the dog,
    pointing him at Guy and the others. “Say hello to everybody! There’s
    Agnes and Esther, <em>see</em> them, Bitsy?”</p>

  <p>The dog yapped crossly instead, and ran at the nose.</p>

  <p>“<em>Is</em> Bitsy-witsy sicky?” cooed Miss Horton, pouting now as she
    allowed Guy to slowly escort her towards a chair near the others, he
    maneuvering her across the room like a gigantic river scow. “Hmm? Is my
    Bitsy sicky-wicky?”</p>

  <p>“Nothing too serious, I hope,” said Grand with a solicitous frown.</p>

  <p>“Just nerves I expect,” said Miss Horton, haughty now, and fairly
    snapping. “The weather is just so ... <em>really abominable</em>, and
    then all the nasty little people about.... Now here’s your Agnes and
    Esther, Bitsy.”</p>

  <p>“How very nice to see you, my dear,” said the two elderly women, each
    laying thin fingers on her enormous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span> hand. “What an adorable little
    sunsuit! It <em>was</em> kind of you to bring your Bitsy—wasn’t it, Guy?”</p>

  <p>“It was extremely kind,” said Guy, beaming as he retreated to his own
    great chair near the window.</p>

  <div class="center">*<span class="col3">*</span>
    <span class="col3">*</span><span class="col3">*</span><span class="col3">*</span></div>

  <p class="noindent">It was, as a matter of fact, Guy Grand who, working through his
    attorneys, had bought controlling interest in the three largest kennel
    clubs on the eastern seaboard last season; and in this way he had
    gained virtual dominance over, and responsibility for, the Dog Show
    that year at Madison Square Garden. His number-one <em>gérant</em>, or
    front man, for this operation was a Señor Hernandez Gonzales, a huge
    Mexican, who had long been known in dog-fancier circles as a breeder of
    blue-ribbon Chihuahuas. With Grand’s backing however, and over a quick
    six months, Gonzales became the celebrated owner of one of the finest
    kennels in the world, known now not simply for Chihuahuas, but for
    Pekinese, Pomeranians and many rare and strange breeds of the Orient.</p>

  <p>It was evident that this season’s show at the Garden was to be a gala
    one—a wealth of new honors had been posted, the prize-money packets
    substantially fattened, and competition was keener than ever. Bright
    young men and wealthy dowagers from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span> all over were bringing forward
    their best and favorite pedigrees. Gonzales himself had promised
    a prize specimen of a fine old breed. A national picture magazine
    devoted its cover to the affair and a lengthy editorial in praise of
    this great American benignity, this love of animals—“... in bright and
    telling contrast,” the editorial said, “to certain naïve barbarities,
    <em>e.g.</em>, the Spanish bullfight.”</p>

  <p>Thus, when the day arrived, all was as it should be. The Garden was
    festively decked, the spectators in holiday reverence, the lights
    burning, the big cameras booming, and the participants dressed as for a
    Papal audience—though slightly ambivalent, between not wishing to get
    mussed or hairy, and yet wanting to pamper and coo over their animals.</p>

  <p>Except for the notable absence of Señor Gonzales, things went smoothly,
    until the final competition began, that between “Best of Breed” for
    the coveted “Best in Show.” And at this point, Gonzales did appear; he
    joined the throng of owners and beasts who mingled in the center of the
    Garden, where it was soon apparent his boast had not been idle—at the
    end of the big man’s leash was an extraordinary dog; he was jet-black
    and almost the size of a full-grown Dane, with the most striking coat
    and carriage yet seen at the Garden show that season. The head was
    dressed somewhat in the manner of a circus-cut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span> poodle, though much
    exaggerated, so that half the face of the animal was truly obscured.</p>

  <p>Gonzales joined the crowd with a jaunty smile and flourish not
    inappropriate to one of his eminence. He hadn’t been there a moment
    though before he and the dog were spotted by Mrs. Winthrop-Garde and
    her angry little spitz.</p>

  <p>She came forward, herself not too unlike her charge, waddling
    aggressively, and she was immediately followed by several other women
    of similar stamp, along with Pekineses, Pomeranians, and ill-tempered
    miniature chows.</p>

  <p>Gonzales bowed with winning old-world grace and caressed the ladies’
    hands.</p>

  <p>“What a <em>perfect</em> love he is!” shrieked Mrs. Winthrop-Garde of
    the animal on Gonzales’s leash, and turning to her own, “<em>Isn’t</em>
    he, my darling? <em>Hmm? Hmm?</em> Isn’t he, my precious sweet? And
    what<em>ever</em> is his <em>name</em>?” she cried to Gonzales when her own
    animal failed to respond, but yapped crossly instead.</p>

  <p>“He is called ... <em>Claw</em>,” said Gonzales with a certain soft drama
    which may have escaped Mrs. Winthrop-Garde, for she rushed on, heedless
    as ever.</p>

  <p>“<em>Claude!</em> It’s <em>too</em> delicious—the perfect darling! Say
    <em>hello</em> to Claude, Angelica! Say <em>hello</em> to Claude, my
    fur-flower!”</p>

  <p>And as she pulled the angry little spitz forward,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span> while it snapped
    and snorted and ran at the nose, an extraordinary thing happened—for
    what this Grand and Gonzales had somehow contrived, and for reasons
    never fathomed by the press, was to introduce in disguise to the Garden
    show that season not a dog at all, but some kind of terrible black
    panther or dyed jaguar—hungry he was too, and cross as a pickle—so that
    before the day was out, he had not only brought chaos into the formal
    proceedings, but had actually destroyed about half the “Best of Breed.”</p>

  <p>During the first hour or so, Gonzales, because of his respected
    position in that circle, was above reproach, and all of the incidents
    were considered as being accidental, though, of course, extremely
    unfortunate.</p>

  <p>“Too much spirit,” he kept explaining, frowning and shaking his head;
    and, as he and the beast stalked slowly about in the midst of the
    group, he would chide the monster-cat:</p>

  <p>“Overtired from the trip, I suppose. Isn’t that it, boy? <em>Hmm?
    Hmm?</em>”</p>

  <p>So now occasionally above the yapping and whining, the crowd would hear
    a strange <em>swish!</em> and <em>swat!</em> as Gonzales and the fantastic
    beast moved on, flushing them one by one.</p>

  <p>Finally one woman, new to the circle, who did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span> know how important
    Gonzales was, came back with an automatic pistol and tried to shoot the
    big cat. But she was so beside herself with righteous fury that she
    missed and was swiftly arrested.</p>

  <p>Gonzales, though, apparently no fool himself, was quick to take this as
    a cue that his work was done, and he gradually retired, so that “Best
    in Show” was settled at last, between those not already eliminated.</p>

  <p>Grand later penned a series of scathing articles about the affair:
    “Scandal of the Dog Show!” “Can This Happen Here?” “Is It Someone’s
    Idea of a Joke?” etc., etc.</p>

  <p>The bereft owners were wealthy and influential people, more than
    eager to go along with the demand for an inquiry. As quickly as
    witnesses were uncovered, however, they were bought off by Grand or
    his representatives, so that nothing really ever came of it in the
    end—though, granted, it did cost him a good bit to keep his own name clear.</p>

  <p class="noindent">“And how was your <em>trip</em>, Guy?” asked Ginger Horton, sniffing a
    bit, just to be on the safe side it seemed.</p>

  <p>Guy shrugged.</p>

  <p>“Oh, same old six-and-seven, Ginger,” he said.</p>

  <p>“I beg your pardon,” interjected his Aunt Agnes smartly.</p>

  <p>Esther beamed, truly in league at last with her long-dead favorite
    sister’s only son.</p>

  <p>“It means <em>not too good</em>, Agnes,” she said emphatically. “It’s
    an expression used in dice-playing: You ‘come out’—isn’t that right,
    Guy?—on ‘six,’ your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span> <em>point</em>, then you throw, in this case, a
    ‘<em>seven</em>,’ which means: <em>no good</em>, <em>you</em> lose.” She
    looked to her Guy. “That’s it, isn’t it, dear?”</p>

  <p>“Oh, it’s a <em>gambling</em> expression,” said Agnes Edwards with a
    certain amused complacency, though she must have raised her cup rather
    too hurriedly, for Esther was content merely to beam at Guy.</p>

  <p>“Then your trip wasn’t ... <em>too good</em>, is that it?” asked Ginger
    Horton seriously, setting her own cup down squarely, pressing the
    napkin briefly to her lips.</p>

  <p>Esther started to answer, but in the end looked to Guy instead.</p>

  <p>“Oh, it’s just a manner of speaking,” said Guy Grand easily. “What
    really gives the expression bite, of course, is that <em>six</em> is
    generally an easy point to make, you see, and, well ... but then the
    fact is really, that the ... uh, the <em>national economy</em>, so to
    speak, isn’t in the best of shape just now. Not a buyer’s market at all
    really. A bit bearish as a matter of fact.” He gave a chuckle, looking
    at the Pekinese.</p>

  <p>Ginger Horton seized the opportunity to bring the dog into it.</p>

  <p>“Well, it’s all over <em>our</em> head, isn’t it, Bitsy? Hmm? Isn’t it
    over your Bitsy-witsy head? Hmmm?”</p>

  <p>“<em>Bearish</em> ...” Esther began to explain.</p>

  <p>“I think we all know what <em>that</em> means, Esther,” said Agnes
    shortly, raising one hand to her throat, her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span> old eyes glittering no
    less than the great diamonds she clutched there.</p>

  <div class="center">*<span class="col3">*</span>
    <span class="col3">*</span><span class="col3">*</span><span class="col3">*</span></div>

  <p class="noindent">Evidently Grand liked playing the donkey-man. In any case, he had
    bought himself a large motion-picture house in Philadelphia. The house
    had been losing money badly for six months, so it was natural that the
    manager and his staff, who knew nothing of Grand’s background, should
    be apprehensive over the probable shake-up.</p>

  <p>The manager was a shrewd and capable man of many years’ experience
    in cinema management, a man whose position represented for him the
    fruit of a life’s work. He decided that his best move, under the
    circumstances, would be to go to Grand and cheerfully recommend salary
    cuts for all.</p>

  <p>During their first conference, however, it was Grand, in his right as
    new owner, who held the initiative throughout.</p>

  <p>By way of preliminary, and while the manager sat alertly on the edge of
    a big leather chair, Grand paced the floor of the comfortable office,
    his hands clasped at his back, and a slight frown on his face. Finally
    he stopped in the center of the room and addressed the manager:</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span></p>

  <p>“The <em>Chinese</em> have an expression, Mr. ... <em>Mister Manager</em>.
    I believe it occurs in the book of the <cite>I Ching</cite>: “Put your house
    in order,” they say, “<em>that</em> is the first step.””</p>

  <p>This brought a flush to the manager’s face and caused him to shift in
    his chair.</p>

  <p>“My dad,” said Grand then, and with severe reverence, “pushed out here
    in ... 1920. There were few frontiers open for him at that time. There
    are fewer still ... open-for-us-today!”</p>

  <p>He faced the manager and would have let him speak; in fact, by looking
    straight into his face, he invited him to do so, but the man could only
    nod in sage agreement.</p>

  <p>“If there is one unexplored territory,” Grand continued, waxing
    expansive now, “one virgin wood alive today in this man’s land of
    ours—it is cinema management! My dad—“Dad Grand”—was a championship
    golfer. That <em>may</em> be why ... now this is only a guess ... but
    that <em>may</em> be why he always favored the maxim: ‘If you want them
    to play your course—don’t put rocks on the green!’”</p>

  <p>Grand paused for a minute, staring down at the manager’s sparkling
    shoes as he allowed his great brow to furrow and his lips to purse,
    frantically pensive. Then he shot a question:</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

  <p>“Do you know the story of the Majestic Theatre in Kansas City?”</p>

  <p>The manager, a man with thirty years’ experience in the field, who knew
    the story of every theatre in the country, did not know this one.</p>

  <p>“In August, 1939, the management of the K.C. Majestic changed hands,
    <em>and</em> policy. Weston seats were installed—four inches wider than
    standard—and ‘a.p.’s,’ admission prices, were cut in half ... and two
    people were to occupy each seat. The new manager, Jason Frank, who died
    of a brain hemorrhage later the same year, had advanced Wyler Publicity
    nine hundred dollars for the catch-phrase, ‘Half the Price, and a
    Chance for Vice,’ which received a wide private circulation.”</p>

  <p>Grand broke off his narrative to give the manager a searching look
    before continuing:</p>

  <p>“... <em>but</em> it didn’t work, sir! It <em>did not</em> work ... and
    I’ll tell you why: it was a <em>crackpot</em> scheme. A crackpot scheme,
    and rocks on the green! It cost Frank his licence, his health, and in
    this case perhaps his very life.”</p>

  <p>Grand paused for effect and crossed to the desk where he took up a
    sheaf of onionskin papers and threshed them about before the manager.
    Each sheet was black with figures.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

  <p>“According to my figures,” he said tersely, “this house will fold in
    nine months’ time unless there is, at minimum, an eight percent climb
    in ‘p.a.’s’—paid admissions.” Here he frowned darkly, let it pass,
    forced a smile, and then flapped his arms a time or two, as he resumed
    speaking, in a much lighter tone now:</p>

  <p>“Of course there are a number of ... of <em>possibilities</em> for
    us here ... I have certain plans ... oh granted they’re tentative,
    under wrap, irons in the fire, if you like—but I <em>can</em> tell you
    <em>this</em>: I am retaining you and your staff. We are not ploughing
    the green under. Do you follow? Right. Now I have arranged for
    this increase in your salaries: ten percent. I won’t say it is a
    <em>substantial</em> increase; I say simply: <em>ten percent</em> ... which
    means, of course, that all ... <em>all these figures</em>”—he waved the
    sheaf of papers in a gesture of hopelessness and then dropped them
    into the wastebasket—“will have to be <em>revised</em>! More time lost
    before we know where we stand! Yet that can’t be helped. It <em>is</em> a
    move—and <em>I</em> say it is a move ... in the right direction!”</p>

  <p>He spoke to the manager for an hour, thinking aloud, getting the feel
    of things, keeping his hand in, and so on. Then he dismissed him for
    three months’ paid vacation.</p>

  <p>Grand’s theatre was one of the city’s largest and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span> had first-run
    rights on the most publicized films. In the manager’s absence, things
    proceeded normally for a while; until one night when the house was
    packed for the opening of the smart new musical, <em>Main Street,
    U.S.A.</em></p>

  <p>First there was an annoying half-hour delay while extra camp-stool
    seats were sold and set up in the aisles; then, when the house lights
    finally dimmed into blackness, and the audience settled back to enjoy
    the musical, Grand gave them something they weren’t expecting: a cheap
    foreign film.</p>

  <p>The moment the film began, people started leaving. In the darkness,
    however, with seats two-abreast choking the aisles, most of them were
    forced back. So the film rolled on; and while the minutes gathered into
    quarter-hours, and each quarter-hour cut cripplingly deep into the
    evening, Grand, locked in the projection room high above, stumbled from
    wall to wall, choking with laughter.</p>

  <p>After forty-five minutes, the film was taken off and it was announced
    over the public-address system, and at a volume strength never before
    used anywhere, that a mistake had been made, that this was <em>not</em>
    the new musical.</p>

  <p>Shouts of “<em>And how!</em>” came from the crowd, and “<em>I’ll say it’s
      not!</em>” and “<em>You’re telling me! God!</em>”</p>

  <p>Then after another delay for rewinding, the cheap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span> foreign film was put
    on again, upside down.</p>

  <p>By ten thirty the house was seething towards angry panic, and Grand
    gave the order to refund the money of everyone who wished to pass by
    the box office. At eleven o’clock there was a line outside the theatre
    two blocks long.</p>

  <p>From his office above, Grand kept delaying the cashier’s work by
    phoning every few minutes to ask: “How’s it going?” or “What’s up?”</p>

  <p>The next day there was a notice on the central bulletin board:</p>

  <p>“Rocks on the green! All hands alert!”</p>

  <p>It also announced another fat pay-hike.</p>

  <p>Into certain films such as <cite>Mrs. Miniver</cite>, Grand made eccentric
    inserts.</p>

  <p>In one scene in <cite>Mrs. Miniver</cite>, Walter Pidgeon was sitting at
    evening in his fire-lit study and writing in his journal. He had just
    that afternoon made the acquaintance of Mrs. Miniver and was no doubt
    thinking about her now as he paused reflectively and looked towards
    the open fire. In the original version of this film, he took a small
    penknife from the desk drawer and meditatively sharpened the pencil
    he had been writing with. During this scene the camera remained on
    his <em>face</em>, which was filled with quiet reflection and modest
    hopefulness, so that the intended emphasis of the scene was quite
    clear: his genteel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span> and wistfully ambitious thoughts about Mrs. Miniver.</p>

  <p>The insert Grand made into this film, was, like those he made
    into others, professionally done, and as such, was technically
    indiscernable. It was introduced just at the moment where Pidgeon
    opened the knife, and it was a three-second close shot of the
    fire-glint blade.</p>

  <p>This simple insert misplaced the emphasis of the scene; the fire-glint
    blade seemed to portend dire evil, and occurring as it did early in the
    story, simply “spoiled” the film.</p>

  <p>Grand would hang around the lobby after the show to overhear the
    remarks of those leaving, and often he would join in himself:</p>

  <p>“What was that part about the <em>knife</em>?” he would demand
    querulously, stalking up and down the lobby, striking his fist into his
    open hand, “... he <em>had</em> that knife ... I thought he was going to
    try and <em>kill</em> her! Christ, I don’t <em>get</em> it!”</p>

  <p>In some cases, Grand’s theatre had to have two copies of the film on
    hand, because his alterations were so flagrant that he did not deem it
    wise to project the altered copy twice in succession. This was the case
    with a popular film called <cite>The Best Years of Our Lives</cite>. This
    film was mainly concerned, in its attempt at an odd kind of realism,
    with a young veteran of war, who was an amputee and had metal hooks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
    instead of hands. It was a story told quite seriously and one which
    depended for much of its drama upon a straight-faced identification
    with the amputee’s situation and attitude. Grand’s insert occurred
    in the middle of the film’s big scene. This original scene was a
    seven-second pan of the two principal characters, the amputee and his
    pretty home-town fiancée while they were sitting on the family porch
    swing one summer evening. The hero was courting her, in his quiet
    way—and this consisted of a brave smile, more or less in apology, it
    would seem, for having the metal hooks instead of hands—while the young
    girl’s eyes shone with tolerance and understanding ... a scene which
    was interrupted by Grand’s insert: a cut to below the girl’s waist
    where the hooks were seen to hover for an instant and then disappear,
    grappling urgently beneath her skirt. The duration of this cut was less
    than one-half second, but was unmistakably seen by anyone not on the
    brink of sleep.</p>

  <p>It brought some of the audience bolt upright. Others the scene affected
    in a sort of double-take way, reacting to it as they did only minutes
    later. The rest, that is to say about one-third of the audience, failed
    to notice it at all; and the film rolled on. No one could believe his
    eyes; those who were positive they had seen something funny in the
    realism there, sat through the film again to make certain—<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>though,
    of course, the altered version was never run twice in succession—but
    <em>all</em> who had seen were so obsessed by what they had seen, or what
    they imagined they had seen, that they could no longer follow the story
    line, though it was, from that point on, quite as it was intended,
    without incongruity or surprise.</p>

  <p>Grand had a good deal of trouble about his alterations of certain films
    and was eventually sued by several of the big studios. You can bet it
    cost him a pretty to keep clear in the end.</p>

  <p>“<em>I think Bitsy’s asleep</em>,” she cooed, then stole a glance at the
    dog. “Isn’t it <em>too</em> sweet!” she said, lifting her face to the
    others, beaming angelically.</p>

  <p>“Oh, it <em>is</em> too sweet!” agreed Agnes and Esther, craning forward
    to see, like ancient things stretching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span> across the sand. “Guy,” hissed
    Agnes, “do come and see!”</p>

  <p>“Best not,” said Guy sagely, “might wake it.”</p>

  <p>“Guy’s right,” said Ginger Horton, compressing her lips tersely and
    cautioning the two ladies back. “Oh, how cross my Bitsy’d be. You
    <em>are</em> sweet, Guy,” she added, with a piercing smile for him—but
    before he could acknowledge it with one of his own, she let a look of
    great care return to her face.</p>

  <p>“I was <em>saying</em> that my Lord Russell books came today.”</p>

  <p>“Lord Russell?” Guy inquired genially.</p>

  <p>“Laird K. Russell,” murmured Esther in pure wonder as some dear
    forgotten name loomed up to marvel her softly from the far far away.</p>

  <p>“<em>Bertrand Russell!</em>” exclaimed Agnes sharply, “the philosopher!
    Good heavens, Esther!”</p>

  <p>“Not Bertrand Russell,” cried Ginger Horton, “Lord Russell of
    Liverpool. The atrocity books!”</p>

  <p>“Good Heavens,” said Agnes.</p>

  <p>“Well, do you know what we did?” Ginger Horton demanded. “Bitsy and I
    sat right down and pretended that <em>this ... this ... Thorndike</em>
    had been <em>captured</em> and brought to justice and all those
    atrocities had been done to him! To him and to a lot of other nasty
    little people we could think of!”</p>

  <p>“Gracious,” exclaimed Agnes.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span></p>

  <p>“Not <em>Bill</em> Thorndike surely?” said Grand, coming forward on his
    chair with a show of concern.</p>

  <p>“Oh, it’s just absolutely <em>maddening</em>!” said Ginger Horton. “I
    don’t even want to ... to <em>talk</em> about it. Not in front of Bitsy,
    anyway.”</p>

  <p>“The dog?” said Grand. “It’s asleep, isn’t it?”</p>

  <p>“Bitsy knows, of course,” said Miss Horton darkly, ignoring this, “and
    only too well!”</p>

  <p>“Ginger,” said Agnes, “can you really be so sure of that?”</p>

  <p>“Oh, in simply a thousand-thousand ways,” said Ginger Horton.</p>

  <p>“Do you remember that young Mr. Laird K. Russell?” asked Esther of
    Agnes in the pause that followed. “He came to our Westport summer ball
    for little Nancy.”</p>

  <p>“Great Heavens, Esther, that was over sixty years ago! Surely you don’t
    mean it!”</p>

  <p>Esther nodded, her eyes dim with distant marvel, a pale smile on her
    lips.</p>

  <p>“Esther, really!”</p>

  <p>Ginger Horton sniffed, at no pains to hide her annoyance with this
    change of focus, while Agnes tried to recover the thread.</p>

  <p>“Do have more tea, Ginger—and please tell us wherever <em>did</em> you
    get that darling little sunsuit? How perfectly clever it is!”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span></p>

  <p>“You <em>are</em> sweet, Agnes,” said Ginger, brightening, yet seeming
    to imply a moment of reproach for Esther and Guy before turning her
    attention to the great pink tent of a sunsuit she was wearing.</p>

  <p>“Yes, I think it’s fun, don’t you? Of course Charles did it for me.”</p>

  <p>“Simply too adorable!” said Agnes. “Isn’t it, Guy?”</p>

  <p>“It’s extremely attractive,” said Guy in most richly masculine and
    persuasive tones, and the ladies beamed all around.</p>

  <p class="noindent">One of Guy Grand’s sayings at conference was this:</p>

  <p>“Show me the man who’s above picking up bits and pieces—and <em>I’ll</em>
    show <em>you</em>: a fool!”</p>

  <p>Just so, Grand himself kept his finger in more than one peripheral pie.
    In 1950 he bought out Vanity Cosmetics, a large and thriving Fifth
    Avenue concern. He surprised staffers at Vanity by bringing in his own
    research chemists, from allied fields. But these staff executives, all
    old-timers themselves, were only waiting for reassurance, and it wasn’t
    long in coming when Grand spoke of fresh blood, new horizons, and
    thinking big.</p>

  <p>“You’ve got to look ahead in this man’s game,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span> emphasized at first
    conference, “or by jumbo you’re up crap creek without a paddle!”</p>

  <p>Granted he spoke harshly, but in his tone was tough jaunty conviction
    and brutal know-how.</p>

  <p>“He’s all right,” said one Vanity staffer after the session. “He speaks
    his mind, and devil take the hindmost!”</p>

  <p>“Joe, he’s my kinda guy,” another was quick to agree. “... I mean what
    the hell, we’re <em>all</em> out for money—am I right, Joe?”</p>

  <p>These regulars though, were more or less cut off from lab contact now,
    as Grand told them he wanted to “go it alone for a bit.”</p>

  <p>“<em>Just</em> want to see how the land lies,” he said.</p>

  <p>He worked tirelessly with his new chemists, himself clad in a great
    white smock, bustling about the lab, seeing to this test and that
    result.</p>

  <p>“Back in harness!” he liked to say at conference (for it was his habit
    to go there wearing his smock), and it made the others feel a bit
    inadequate—spic and span as they were in their smart tweeds and clergy
    gray—while the new chief sat stained and pungent from the lab.</p>

  <p>“You civies have a soft touch here,” Grand would tweak them—though of
    course they were only too eager now to go to the lab themselves.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span></p>

  <p>“You know I wouldn’t mind a crack at the lab,” one of the senior exec’s
    would say with serious mien if he could get Grand aside.</p>

  <p>“Yes, I’ll just bet you wouldn’t,” Grand would reply with a glittering
    smile, “and how about a handful of these while you’re at it?” and he
    would flash a fat roll of ten thousands that he could just get into the
    catch-all pocket of his big white smock.</p>

  <p>Though the exec might suspect that Grand was speaking symbolically, the
    gambit was always impressive.</p>

  <p>“<em>Yes, sir</em>,” would be the earnest reply, “I really <em>would</em>
    like a crack at the lab!”</p>

  <p>But Grand would grimace oddly and wave a finger at the senior staffer;
    then he would give a thin cackling laugh and fly to his flasks and
    beakers.</p>

  <p>“The old boy’s sharp as a razor,” most of them said. “He’s my kinda
    guy.”</p>

  <p>What happened in the end was the development of a couple of fairly
    new products. The first was <em>Downy</em>, a combination shampoo and
    soft-set; and it was heralded by a large-scale promotional campaign.
    The formula of <em>Downy</em> was supposedly based on a principle used
    by the Egyptians in the preservation of their dead—though this was
    but vaguely referred to, being simply the scientific springboard for
    the product and thereby catching the endorsement of men in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span> various
    fields, and gaining press coverage beyond mere paid advertisement. The
    main promotional emphasis though was on the social allure and overall
    security it seemed to promise. “<span class="allsmcap">DOWNY</span>,” according to these
    releases, “<em>will make your hair ... softer than the hair of</em> YOUR
    OWN CHILD!”</p>

  <p>It was unconditionally guaranteed to do so. These releases went on
    to present certain inductive proofs that the formula of <em>Downy</em>
    had been “Cleopatra’s secret,” that in reality she had been a
    woman of “only average prettiness (<em>which one must never never
    underestimate</em>)” and that she had won her thrones and her men with
    “what is <em>now</em> YOUR OWN ... <span class="gesperrt2">DOWNY</span>.”</p>

  <p>The promotional campaign was in progress for quite a while before the
    product was offered to the general buyer, though it had of course
    been used with amazing success for a long time by a number of famous
    beauties, and there were plenty of testimonials to that effect. So that
    when it was finally offered, the sales ran high indeed.</p>

  <p>“I think we’ve hit on something here,” said the smock-stained veteran,
    Grand Guy Grand, at conference with the staffers as the market
    tabulations poured in that first morning. “I <em>don’t</em> like to count
    the chickens so to speak, but <em>I think</em> we’ve hit on something
    here ... something that may well spell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span> ‘touchdown’ in the hearts of
    Mr. and Mrs. U.S.A.!”</p>

  <p>The others were agreeing wildly, but Grand was quick to show conference
    acumen, “... <em>not</em> count the chickens, I say”—and he raised a
    cautionary finger—“<em>nor</em> put all in <em>one basket!</em>”</p>

  <p>And even as he hinted at research for another new product already under
    way, adverse reports about the soft-set began coming in by the carload.
    For what this Grand Guy in his work with the new chemists had contrived
    was a potion that did <em>not</em> soften the hair, after all, but on the
    contrary, made it <em>all stiff and wiry</em>.</p>

  <p>As the reports flooded in, along with an avalanche of lawsuits,
    staffers at the conference table grew restive.</p>

  <p>“Well, can’t win ’em all,” said Grand with a good loser’s chuckle.
    “Common Zen savvy tells us as much,” and he was content to dismiss the
    product’s failure with this, eager now to get started on something new;
    but as it became ever more apparent that their million-dollar planning
    had gone so terribly wrong, the staffers got panicky.</p>

  <p>“We do our best,” said Grand, shaking his head stoically. “No man can
    say more.”</p>

  <p>It appeared though that one of the senior execs, a white-haired man of
    about forty-two, might actually jump out the window.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>

  <p>Grand, who held the initiative throughout most of the conferences,
    quietly led the man back to the table, and summed up in this way:</p>

  <p>“Talk is cheap, gentlemen, and since I’m not one personally to favor
    tired phrases, I <em>think</em> I’ll spare you the grand old maxim about
    ‘spilt milk,’ but I do want to say this: Show me the man who <em>looks
      back</em>—and <em>I’ll</em> show <em>you</em>: a first-rate imbecile!”</p>

  <p>This brought conference around, and under Grand’s good guidance, they
    ignored the raging anathema without and looked to the future.</p>

  <p>“Our M.R. people have come up with something,” said Grand, “—that’s
    what we pay them for—well, they’ve come up with a couple of consumer
    principles we can kick around here at conference: one, the insatiate
    craving of the public for an <em>absolute</em>; and two, the modern
    failure of monotheism—that is to say, the <em>failure</em> of the notion
    that <em>any absolute</em> can be presented as one separate thing.”</p>

  <p>Grand paused to touch his fingers together before him, shooting sharply
    evaluative looks at several staffers nearest before he continued:</p>

  <p>“And they’re quite right, of course. We of the ... the extreme
    occident, for right or wrong—and there I’ve said it myself—think in
    <em>dichotomies</em> ... have done so since our very inception. Oneness?
    Never had a chance in this great land of ours! Well, I ask<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span> you
    staffers, where does that leave us? Monotheism shot to pieces on the
    one hand—dire craving for an absolute existing on the other. I submit
    to you staffers that the solution establishes itself before our very
    eyes: namely, that an <em>absolute</em>—in any particular field—must be
    presented as a <em>dichotomy</em>! Yes, if one mother company, such as
    our Vanity, could confront the public with a <em>pure dichotomy</em>,
    in any particular product, it would gain virtual monopoly there. Yes,
    and <em>we</em> will present such a dichotomy! Two sides which embrace
    the extremes and meet in the middle! I say people will make their
    choice <em>within</em> the dichotomy presented by the mother company;
    they will not go outside it, because then the issue would become vague
    and the implications of the choice no longer clear and satisfying ...
    <em>satisfying</em> in terms, I mean to say, of the self-orientation for
    which they <em>do</em>, in the last analysis, buy these products at all.
    Are there any dissensions from the view I’ve expressed?”</p>

  <p>There were none to speak of and Grand continued briefly:</p>

  <p>“Now what we want is one product which we can present in the two
    forms—good and evil, old and new, primitive and civilized—two items
    designed for the same use but presented as completely antithetical,
    both morally and philosophically—not aesthetically, however ...
    packaging will be high-tone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span> and identical, let the departments
    concerned take note ... now do any of you—execs, staffers—know what
    that product might be?”</p>

  <p>They did not, but this was evidently just a teaser anyhow, for Grand
    had already selected his product, and the work on it even now was
    under way. It was to be a body deodorant of course—presented, as he
    had suggested, in two forms. The first was traditional, combining
    the clinical and the erotic, offering, as it did, “... <em>Protection
    for Those Most Precious Moments of All—It Cuts Away Body Odor like a
    Knife</em>.” It was technically superior to any others on the market,
    making use of “... liquid glass, harmless plastic sealers ...” and
    so on. It was called <em>Stealth</em>. The second deodorant was based
    on another principle altogether, <em>biology</em>. An ancient wisdom
    revived, it had to do with natural selection among mating animals, and
    did, according to eminent and quoted authorities, rest securely on the
    olfactory motive-response by which animals find and achieve harmonious,
    monogamous relationships. Thus, the second product was designed not
    to obscure the natural body odor but to cleverly assert it. And, in
    M.R. terms, an undeniable correspondence and natural attraction would
    result between appropriate compatible persons. It was called <em>Musk
    and Tallow</em>. An irritant jingle, in stereophonic sound, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span> the
    high-velocity repetition principle, was to be used: “<em>Don’t Lie
    Fallow—Musk and Tallow!</em>” repeated many many times within a few
    seconds.</p>

  <p>It was also decided that owing to the failure of <em>Downy</em>, it would
    be to certain advantage to make a clear break at this point and change
    the name of the mother company—a new name which would embrace both
    aspects of the M.R. postulate; and so it was decided: LADY APHRODITE.</p>

  <p>Grand arranged that a number of prominent biologists, physicians,
    philosophers, church representatives, film stars, congresswomen,
    nursery-school teachers, and so on, should come forward in unsolicited
    endorsement of the moral correctness and practicality of the product.</p>

  <p>Promotionwise, it did seem to capture the imagination of the public.
    Grand’s contention at conference was that it appealed to the
    “magnificent bohemian strain in the great middle class,” and “to the
    return-to-nature elements dormant within them like a sleeping giant.”</p>

  <p>“In offering these two products across this grand land of ours,”
    he said at final conference, “Lady Aphrodite has presented a pure
    dichotomy. At last a satisfactory choice may be made, a side taken, and
    yet <em>each side</em> shall enjoy the security—on this particular issue
    at least—of <em>operating within an absolute</em>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span> Gentlemen, I say this
    product may well spell ‘home-run’ in the hearts of Mr. and Mrs. U.S.A.!”</p>

  <p>Small matter though, for both products were, as it turned
    out, nothing more nor less than some kind of delayed-action
    <em>stench-bomb</em>—hydrogen sulfide or the like—causing a great stench
    and embarrassment to a number of people. Apparently it was simply
    another joke by Grand at their expense, and not altogether in the best
    of taste. At least so the press thought (when they got wind of it) and
    they were down on this Grand and his staffers like the proverbial ton.
    It cost him plenty to clear.</p>

  <p class="noindent">“And how is our Miss Sally Hastings these days?” Agnes asking this
    genially of Ginger Horton while giving Guy a meaningfully coy
    glance—for she had tried to interest her nephew in the young lady.</p>

  <p>“Poor Sally,” said Ginger Horton, putting on her look of extremest
    nonchalance. “She’s become rather tiresome, I’m afraid.”</p>

  <p>“That <em>is</em> a shame,” said Agnes. “Such a lovely girl—didn’t you

    of them are, aren’t they—young girls, I mean, of her sort? Personally,

  <p class="noindent">Grand’s entrance into the world of championship boxing, significant
    though it may have been, went completely unnoticed by the savants of
    the press. They continued about their business, promoting the Champ.
    They said the Champ had plenty of heart and moxie, and that while he
    might not be the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span> brightest guy in the whole world, by golly, he was
    nobody’s fool, and pound for pound, he could punch with the best of them.</p>

  <p>In the columns they set up hypothetical matches:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">Maybe you’re asking, “Could the Champ have taken the Rock’s
      primeval right-cross?” The answer to that? He <em>could</em>, and he
      could have dished something out to boot! “<em>But</em>,” you want to
      know, “<em>could</em> he have handled the Bomber’s Sunday-one, I mean
      the one that could snap a two-by-four from nine inches!” Look, you
      want me to tell you something? If Champy couldn’t roll that punch,
      you know what he <em>could</em> do? He could just <em>laugh</em> it
      off! “Granted,” you say, “but could the Champ have lasted with Big
      John L., when the chips were down bloody-bare-bone-knuckle in the
      108th stanza?” You want my answer to that, buddy? Okay, I’ll tell
      you something. I was standing with the Champ and his gray-haired
      Mom one Saturday afternoon on the corner of Darrow and Lex when
      some punk hood comes up and starts slapping Champ’s Mom around.</p>

    <p>“You dirty old slut!” he yelled, slapping her around. The Champ’s
      Mom! Can you imagine!?! <em>Well</em>, if you think the American
      heavyweight boxing champion of the world stands idle while some
      cheap runt of a punk roughs up his <em>Mom</em>—<em>you’ve</em> got
      another think coming, Mister! <em>You’d</em> better put on your
      think-cap, Mister! The answer is <em>N</em> ... <em>O</em> ... spells
      “NO!” “Okay,” you say, “so far, so <span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>hunky-do-ray-me, but could the
      Champ have notched Demetrias—when Demi was swinging with the old
      net and trident, and the Champ was hog-tied?” What? You want my
      answer to that buddy? Okay, just listen. If Champ....</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The Champ was a national hero. He became a TV personality, and his
    stock in trade was a poignant, almost incredible, ignorance. He was
    good-natured and lovably stupid—and, boy-oh-boy, was he <em>tough</em>!</p>

  <p>Well, Grand got through somehow, put his cards on the table (two
    million, tax-free) and made an arrangement whereby the Champ would
    throw the next fight in a gay or effeminate manner and, in fact, would
    behave that way all the time, on TV, in the ring, everywhere—swishing
    about, grimacing oddly, flinching when he struck a match, and so on.</p>

  <p>The next big bout was due to go quite differently now. The challenger
    in this case was a thirty-three-year-old veteran of the ring named
    Texas Powell. Tex had an impressive record: 40 wins (25 by K.O.), 7
    losses and 3 draws. He had been on the scene for quite a while and was
    known, or so the press insisted, as a “rugged customer,” and a “tough
    cookie.”</p>

  <p>“Tex has got the punch,” they said. “The big <em>if</em> is: Can he
    deliver it? Will he remain conscious long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span> enough to deliver it?
    <em>There’s</em> your Big If in tonight’s Garden bout!”</p>

  <p>Well, the fix was in with Tex too, of course—not simply to carry
    the fight, but to do so in the most flamboyantly homosexual manner
    possible. And finally, a fix—or <em>zinger</em>, as it was called in
    those days—was in with the Commission as well, a precaution taken under
    best advice as it turned out, because what happened in the ring that
    night was so “funny” that the bout might well have been halted at the
    opening bell.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, what did happen didn’t last too long. The Champ and the
    challenger capered out from their corners with a saucy mincing step,
    and, during the first cagey exchange—which on the part of each was
    like nothing so much as a young girl striking at a wasp with her left
    hand—uttered little cries of surprise and disdain. Then Texas Powell
    took the fight to the Champ, closed haughtily, and engaged him with a
    pesky windmill flurry which soon had the Champ covering up frantically,
    and finally shrieking, “I can’t <em>stand</em> it!” before succumbing
    beneath the vicious peck and flurry, to lie in a sobbing tantrum on
    the canvas, striking his fists against the floor of the ring—more the
    bad loser than one would have expected. Tex tossed his head with smug
    feline contempt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span> and allowed his hand to be raised in victory—while, at
    the touch, eyeing the ref in a questionable manner.</p>

  <p>Apparently a number of people found the spectacle so abhorrent that
    they actually blacked-out.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Grand’s work in cinema management and film editing had apparently not
    diminished his strong feeling for dramatic theatre, so that with the
    cultural ascension of television drama, he was all the more keen to
    get, as he put it, “<em>back on the boards</em>.”</p>

  <p>“There’s no biz like show biz,” he liked to quip to the other troupers,
    “... oh, we have our ups and downs, heck yes—but I wouldn’t trade one
    whiff of grease paint on opening night, by gosh, for all the darn
    châteaux of France!”</p>

  <p>Thus did he enter the field, not nominally of course, but in effect.
    There was at this time a rather successful drama hour on Sunday
    evening. “Our Town Playhouse” it was called and was devoted to serious
    fare; at least the viewers were told it was serious fare—truth to
    tell though, it was by any civilized standard, the crassest sort of
    sham, cant, and weak-kneed pornography imaginable. Grand set about to
    interfere with it.</p>

  <p>His arrival was fairly propitious; the production in dress rehearsal
    at that moment was called <cite>All Our Yesterdays</cite>, a drama which,
    according to the sponsors,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span> was to be, concerning certain emotions and
    viewpoints, more or less <em>definitive</em>.</p>

  <p>Beginning with this production, Grand made it a point that he or his
    representative contact the hero or heroine of each play, while it was
    still in rehearsal, and reach some sort of understanding about final
    production. A million was generally sufficient.</p>

  <p>The arrangement between Grand and the leading actress of <cite>All Our
    Yesterdays</cite> was simplicity itself. During final production, that
    is to say, the Sunday-night nation-wide presentation of the play,
    and at the top of her big end-of-the-second-act scene, the heroine
    suddenly turned away from the other players, approached the camera, and
    addressed the viewers, point-blank:</p>

  <p>“Anyone who would allow this slobbering pomp and drivel in his home has
    less sense and taste than the beasts of the field!”</p>

  <p>Then she pranced off the set.</p>

  <p>Half the remaining actors turned to stare after her in amazement, while
    the others sat frozen in their last attitudes. There was a frenzy of
    muffled whispers coming from off-stage:</p>

  <p>“What the hell!”</p>

  <p>“Cue! Cue!”</p>

  <p>“<em>Fade it! For Christ’s sake, fade it!</em>”</p>

  <p>Then there was a bit of commotion before it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span> actually faded—one of
    the supporting actors had been trained in Russian methods and thought
    he could improvise the rest of the play, about twelve minutes, so there
    were one or two odd lines spoken by him in this attempt before the
    scene jerkily faded to blackness. A short documentary film about tarpon
    fishing was put on to fill out the balance of the hour.</p>

  <p>The only explanation was that the actress had been struck by insanity;
    but even so, front-office temper ran high.</p>

  <p>On the following Sunday, the production, <cite>Tomorrow’s Light</cite>, took
    an unexpected turn while the leading actor, in the role of an amiable
    old physician, was in the midst of an emergency operation. His brow was
    knit in concern and high purpose, as the young nurse opposite watched
    his face intently for a sign.</p>

  <p>“Dr. Lawrence,” she said, “do you ... do you think you can save Dr.
    Chester’s son?”</p>

  <p>Without relaxing his features, the doctor smiled, a bit grimly it
    seemed, before raising his serious brown eyes to her own.</p>

  <p>“I’m afraid it isn’t a question of saving <em>him</em>, Miss Nurse—I only
    wish it were—it’s a question of saving my dinner.”</p>

  <p>The nurse evidenced a questioning look, just concealing the panic
    beneath it (<em>for he had missed his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span> cue!</em>), so, laying aside his
    instruments, he continued, as in explanation:</p>

  <p>“Yes, you see, I really think if I speak one more line of this drivel
    I’ll lose my dinner.” He nodded gravely at the table, “... vomit right
    into that incision I’ve made.” He slowly drew off his rubber gloves,
    regarding the astonished nurse as he did so with mild indignation.</p>

  <p>“Perhaps that would be <em>your</em> idea of a pleasant Sunday evening,
    Miss Nurse,” he said reproachfully. “Sorry, it <em>isn’t</em> mine!” And
    he turned and strode off the set.</p>

  <p>The third time something like this happened, the producer and sponsor
    were very nearly out of their minds. Of course they suspected that a
    rival company was tampering with the productions, bribing the actors
    and so on. Security measures were taken. Directors were fired right
    and left. Rehearsals were held behind locked doors, and there was an
    attempt to keep the actors under constant surveillance, but ... Grand
    always seemed to get in there somehow, with the old convincer.</p>

  <p>In the aftermath, some of the actors paid the breach-of-contract fine
    of twenty-five or fifty thousand; others pleaded temporary insanity;
    still others gained a lot of publicity by taking a philosophic stand,
    saying that it was true, they had been overcome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span> with nausea at that
    drivel, and that they themselves were too sensitive and serious for
    it, had too much integrity, moral fiber, etc. With a million behind
    them, none seemed to lack adequate defense arrangements. Those who were
    kicked out of their union usually became producers.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the show went on. People started tuning in to see what new
    outrage would happen; it even appeared to have a sort of elusive comic
    appeal. It became the talk of the industry; the rating soared—but
    somehow it looked bad. Finally the producer and the sponsor of the show
    were put on the carpet before Mr. Harlan, the tall and distinguished
    head of the network.</p>

  <p>“Listen,” he said to the sponsor as he paced the office, “we want your
    business, Mr. Levet, don’t get me wrong—but if you guys can’t control
    that show of yours ... well, I mean <em>goddamn</em> it, what’s going on
    over there?” He turned to the producer now, who was a personal friend
    of his: “For Christ’s sake, Max, can’t you get together a <em>show</em>,
    and put it on the way it’s supposed to be without any somersaults? ...
    is <em>that</em> so hard to do?... I mean <em>we</em> can’t have this sort
    of thing going on, <em>you</em> know that, Max, we <em>simply cannot
    have</em>....”</p>

  <p>“Listen, Al,” said the producer, a short fat man who rose up and down
    on his toes, smiling, as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span> spoke, “we got the highest Trendex in the
    books right now.”</p>

  <p>“Max, goddamn it, I’d have the FCC down on my neck in another
    week—<em>you</em> can’t schedule one kind of hour—have something go
    haywire every time and fill out with something else.... I mean what the
    <em>hell</em> you got over there ... <em>two</em> shows or <em>one</em>, for
    Christ’s sake!”</p>

  <p>“We got the top Trendex in the biz, Al.”</p>

  <p>“There are some goddamn things that are against the law, Max, and that
    kind of stuff you had going out last week, that ‘<em>I pity the moron
    whose life is so empty he would look at this</em>,’ and that kind of
    crap <em>cannot go out over the air</em>! Don’t you understand that? It’s
    not <em>me</em>, Max, you know that. I wouldn’t give a goddamn if you
    had a ... a <em>mule</em> up there throwing it to some hot broad, I only
    wish we could, for Christ’s sake—but there <em>is a question of lawful
    procedure</em> and....”</p>

  <p>“How about if it’s ‘healthy satire of the media,’ Al?”</p>

  <p>“... and—<em>what?</em>”</p>

  <p>“We got the top of the book, Al.”</p>

  <p>“Wait a minute....”</p>

  <p>“We got it, Al.”</p>

  <p>“Wait a minute, Max, I’m thinking, for Christ’s sake ... ‘healthy
    satire of the media’.... <em>It’s</em> an angle, <em>it’s</em> an angle.
    Jones might buy it ... Jones at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span> the FCC ... if I could get to him
    first ... he’s stupid enough to buy it. Okay, it’s an angle, Max—that’s
    all I can say right now ... it’s an angle.”</p>

  <p>The critics for the most part, after lambasting the first couple of
    shows as “terrific boners,” sat tight for a while, just to see which
    way the wind was going to blow, so to speak—then, with the rating at
    sky-rocket level, they began to suggest that the show might be worth a
    peek.</p>

  <p>“An off-beat sleeper,” one of them said, “don’t miss it.”</p>

  <p>“<em>New</em> comedy,” said a second, “a sophisticated take-off on the
    sentimental.”</p>

  <p>And another: “Here’s humor at its highest.”</p>

  <p>Almost all agreed in the end that it was healthy satire.</p>

  <p>After interfering with six or seven shows, Grand grew restive.</p>

  <p>“I’m pulling out,” he said to himself, “it may have been good money
    after bad all along.”</p>

  <p>It was just as well perhaps, because at the point when the producer and
    sponsor became aware of what was responsible for their vast audience,
    they began consciously trying to choose and shape each drama towards
    that moment of anomaly which had made the show famous. And somehow
    this seemed to spoil it. At any rate it very soon degenerated—back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span> to
    the same old tripe. And of course it was soon back to the old rating
    as well—which, as in the early, pre-Grand days, was all right, but
    nothing, really, to be too proud of.</p>

  <p class="noindent">“Would you like to know why I remember that young Laird K. Russell so
    vividly, Agnes?” Esther was asking.</p>

  <p>Ginger Horton sniffed to show unqualified disinterest and murmured
    something to her sleeping Bitsy.</p>

  <p>“Esther, you can’t be serious,” said Agnes, turning to the others with
    a brilliant smile. “More tea, anyone?”</p>

  <p>“I most certainly <em>would</em> like to know,” said Grand, actually
    coming forward a little on his chair.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>

  <p>“Well,” said Esther, “it was because he looked like my father.”</p>

  <p>“Esther, really!” cried Agnes.</p>

  <p>“I mean <em>our</em> father, of course,” Esther amended. “Yes, Agnes, he
    looked just like the photographs of Poppa as a young man. It struck me
    then, but I didn’t realize it at the time. So perhaps it’s not Laird K.
    Russell I’m remembering, you see, even now, but those photographs. You
    didn’t know him, of course, Guy—he was a truly remarkable man.”</p>

  <p>“Young Russell do you mean, or Poppa?” asked Guy.</p>

  <p>“Why Poppa, of course—surely you don’t know Laird K. Russell?”</p>

  <p>“Esther, in the name of heaven!” cried Agnes. “He’s probably
    <em>dead</em> by now! How <em>can</em> you go on so about the man?
    Sometimes I wonder if you aren’t trying quite deliberately to
    <em>upset</em> me....”</p>

  <div class="center">*<span class="col3">*</span>
    <span class="col3">*</span><span class="col3">*</span><span class="col3">*</span></div>

  <p class="noindent">Speaking of upsets though, Grand upset the equilibrium of a rather
    smart Madison Avenue advertising agency, Jonathan Reynolds, Ltd., by
    secretly buying it—<em>en passant</em>, so to speak—and putting in as
    president a pygmy.</p>

  <p>At that time it was rare for a man of this skin-pigmentation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span> or
    stature (much the less both) to hold down a top-power post in one of
    these swank agencies, and these two handicaps would have been difficult
    to overcome—though perhaps could have been overcome in due time had the
    chap shown a reasonable amount of savoir-faire and general ability,
    or the promise of developing it. In this case, however, Grand had
    apparently paid the man to behave in an eccentric manner—to scurry
    about the offices like a squirrel and to chatter raucously in his
    native tongue. It was more than a nuisance.</p>

  <p>An account executive, for example, might be entertaining an extremely
    important client in his own office, a little tête-à-tête of the very
    first seriousness—perhaps with an emissary of one of the soap-flake
    kings—when the door would burst open and in would fly the president,
    scrambling across the room and under the desk, shrieking pure
    gibberish, and then out he’d go again, scuttling crabwise over the
    carpet, teeth and eyes blazing.</p>

  <p>“What in God’s name was that?” the client would ask, looking slowly
    about, his face pocked with a terrible frown.</p>

  <p>“Why, that ... that....” But the a.e. could not bring himself to tell,
    not after the first few times anyway. Evidently it was a matter of
    pride.</p>

  <p>Later this a.e. might run into one of his friends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span> from another agency,
    and the friend would greet him:</p>

  <p>“Say, hear you’ve got a new number one over at J.R., Tommy—what’s the
    chap like?”</p>

  <p>“Well, as a matter of fact, Bert....”</p>

  <p>“You don’t mean the old boy’s got you on the <em>mat</em> already, Tommy.
    Ha-ha. <em>That</em> what you’re trying to say?”</p>

  <p>“No, Bert, it’s ... well I don’t know, Bert, I <em>just don’t know</em>.”</p>

  <p>It was a matter of pride, of course. As against it, salaries had been
    given a fairly stiff boost, <em>and</em> titles. If these dapper execs
    were to go to another agency now, it would be at a considerable loss
    of dollars and cents. Most of the old-timers—and the younger ones too,
    actually—had what it took to stick it out there at J.R.</p>

  <p class="noindent">“These sweet fluffs <em>are</em> good,” said Ginger Horton, daintily
    taking what was perhaps her ninth cream puff from a great silver tray
    at hand, and giving Guy Grand a most coquettish look.</p>

  <p>“Takes one to know one,” said Guy, beaming and rolling his eyes.</p>

  <p>Esther twittered, and Agnes looked extremely pleased.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span></p>

  <div class="center">*<span class="col3">*</span>
    <span class="col3">*</span><span class="col3">*</span><span class="col3">*</span></div>

  <p class="noindent">Grand made quite a splash in the fall of ’58 when he entered the
    “big-car” field with his sports line of Black Devil Rockets, a
    gigantic convertible. There were four models of the Rocket, each
    with a different fanciful name, though, except for the color of the
    upholstery, all four cars were identical. The big convertible was
    scaled in the proportions of an ordinary automobile, but was tremendous
    in size—was, in fact, <em>longer and wider than the largest Greyhound
    Bus in operation</em>.</p>

  <p>“THERE’S POWER TO SPARE UNDER THIS BIG BABY’S FORTY-FOOT HOOD!” was a
    sales claim that gained attention.</p>

  <p>Fronting the glittering crystal dash were two “racing-cup” seats with
    a distance of ten feet between them, and the big “gang’s-all-here”
    seat in back would accommodate twelve varsity crewmen abreast in roomy
    comfort.</p>

  <p>“Buy Yourself One <em>Whale</em> of a Car, Buddy!” read the giant ads.
    “From Stem to Stern She’s a Flat One Hundred Feet! Ladylike Lines on a
    He-Man Hunk of Car!”</p>

  <p>Performance figures were generally side-stepped, but a number
    of three-color billboards and full-page ads were headed:
    “<em>Performance?</em> Ask the Fella Behind the Wheel!” and featured, in
    apparently authentic testimonial, one of the Indianapolis speed kings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
    behind the wheel of the mammoth convertible. A larger than average
    man, he was incredibly dwarfed by the immense dimensions of the car.
    His tiny face, just visible at the top of the wheel, was split in a
    grin of insanity, like a toothpaste ad, a madman’s laugh frozen at the
    nightmare peak of hilarity, and it was captioned:</p>

  <p>“<em>Getting the feel of this big baby has been one real thrill, believe
      you me!</em>”</p>

  <p>The four identical models were shown at a display room on Fifth Avenue,
    and though considered beyond the price range of most, were evidently
    sold. At any rate, on the last day of the exposition they were driven
    away, out and into the streets of mid-town Manhattan during the five
    o’clock rush.</p>

  <p>Despite their roominess, power, and road-holding potential, the big
    cars did prove impractical in the city, because their turning-arc—for
    the ordinary 90° change of direction—was greater than the distance
    between the street-angled buildings, so that by five thirty all four
    of the sleek Devil Rockets were wedged at angles across various
    intersections around Columbus Circle, each a barrier to thoroughfare
    in four directions, and causing quite a snarl indeed until cranes and
    derricks could be brought up from the East River to pry the big cars
    out.</p>

  <p>New York authorities were quick to respond to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span> flood of protests
    and got out an injunction to prevent Black Devil Rocket Corp. from
    further production.</p>

  <p>“Personally,” said one high-ranking city official, in an off-the-record
    remark in defense of the court’s ruling—which was, after all,
    a flagrant infringement on the rights of free enterprise—“...
    <em>personally</em> I frankly think the car is an ugly car and a ...
    a <em>pretentious</em> car, and, as experience has shown us, it is an
    impractical car. I’ll bet it’s plenty expensive to run, too.”</p>

  <p>At last account though, Grand—himself fairly well in the background—was
    carrying on, pressing his fight to get the go-ahead and swing into full
    production with the big baby.</p>

  <p class="noindent">“You <em>must</em> stay to dinner, Ginger,” said Agnes. “And there
    <em>might</em> be a nice bit of fillet for our Bitsy,” she added
    knowingly. “Do let me tell Cook you will!”</p>

  <p>“But, my dear, we simply couldn’t,” said Ginger, casting a look flushed
    with girlish pride down at her own great scanty costume. “What about
    your nigras?”</p>

  <p>“Cook and kitchen staff?” said Agnes, genuinely surprised. “Why,
    Ginger, really! But what’s your feeling on it, Guy?”</p>

  <p>“Sorry, don’t follow,” said Guy.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

  <p>“Well, Ginger seems to think that our servers might be ... might be....”</p>

  <p>“Might be sent straight off their rockers with bestial desire, you
    mean?” asked Grand tersely. “Hmm—Ginger may be right. Better safe than
    sorry in these matters I’ve always said.”</p>

  <div class="center">*<span class="col3">*</span>
    <span class="col3">*</span><span class="col3">*</span><span class="col3">*</span></div>

  <p class="noindent">Guy liked playing the fool, it’s true—though some say there was more
    to his antics than met the eye. At any rate, one amusing diversion
    in which he took a central role himself was when he played <em>grand
    gourmet</em> at the world’s most luxurious restaurants.</p>

  <p>Guy would arrive in faultless evening attire, attended by his
    poker-faced valet, who carried a special gourmet’s chair and a large
    valise of additional equipment. The chair, heavily weighted at the
    bottom so it could not be easily overturned, was also fitted with a big
    waist strap which was firmly secured around Grand’s middle as soon as
    he was seated. Then the valet would take from the valise a huge rubber
    bib and attach it to Guy while the latter surveyed the menu in avid
    conference with a bevy of hosts—the maître d’, the senior waiter, the
    wine steward, and at least one member of the chef’s staff.</p>

  <p>Guy Grand was the last of the big spenders and, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span> such, a great
    favorite at these restaurants; due to his eccentric behavior during the
    meal however, the management always took care to place him at a table
    as decentralized as possible—on the edge of the terrace, in a softly
    lit alcove, or, preferably, at a table entirely obscured by a canopy
    arrangement which many restaurants, after his first visit, saw fit to
    have on hand for Guy’s return.</p>

  <p>Following the lengthy discussion to determine the various courses, the
    waist strap was checked, and Guy would sit back in his chair, rubbing
    his hands together in sophisticated anticipation of the taste treats to
    come.</p>

  <p>When the first course did arrive, an extraordinary spectacle would
    occur. At the food’s very aroma, Grand, still sitting well back from
    the table, as in fanatical self-restraint, would begin to writhe
    ecstatically in his chair, eyes rolling, head lolling, saliva streaming
    over his ruddy jowls. Then he would suddenly stiffen, his face a mask
    of quivering urgency, before shouting: “<em>Au table!</em>” whereupon he
    would lurch forward, both arms cupped out across the table, and wildly
    scoop the food, dishes and all, towards his open mouth. Following
    this fantastic clatter and commotion—which left him covered from the
    top of his head to his waist with food—the expressionless valet would
    lean forward and unfasten the chair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span> strap, and Guy would bolt from
    the table and rush pell-mell towards the kitchen, covered and dripping
    with food, hair matted with it, one arm extended full length as in a
    congratulatory handshake, shouting at the top of his voice:</p>

  <p>“<i lang="fr">MES COMPLIMENTS AU CHEF!</i>”</p>

  <p>Upon his return to the table, he would be strapped into the chair
    again, hosed-down by a little water pump from the valet’s case, and
    dried with a big towel; then the performance would be repeated with
    each course.</p>

  <p>Restaurants who used a special canopy to conceal Grand from the other
    diners did so at considerable risk, because at the moment of completing
    each course he would bolt for the kitchen so quickly that, unless
    the waiters were extremely alert and dexterous in pulling aside the
    canopy, he would bring the thing down on his head and, like a man in a
    collapsed tent, would flail about inside it, upsetting the table, and
    adding to the general disturbance, or worse, as sometimes did happen,
    he might regain his feet within the canopy and careen blindly through
    the plush restaurant, toppling diners everywhere, and spreading the
    disturbance—and, of course, if he ever reached the kitchen while still
    inside the canopy, it could be actually calamitous.</p>

  <p>The open-mouthed astonishment of waiters, diners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span> and others who were
    witness to these scenes was hardly lessened by the bits of bland
    dialogue they might overhear between the maître d’, who was also in on
    the gag, and the valet.</p>

  <p>“Chef’s <em>Béarnaise</em> pleased him,” the maître d’ would remark
    soberly to the valet, “I could tell.”</p>

  <p>The valet would agree with a judicious nod, as he watched Grand
    storming through the restaurant. “He’s awful keen tonight.”</p>

  <p>“In the <em>Béarnaise</em>,” the maître d’ would suddenly confide in
    an excited whisper, “the peppercorns were <em>bruised</em> merely by
    dropping them!” And the two men would exchange dark knowing glances at
    this revelation.</p>

  <p>By the last course Grand would be utterly exhausted, and the exquisite
    dessert would invariably prove too much for his overtaxed senses.
    At the first taste of it, he would go into a final tantrum and then
    simply black out. He always had to be carried from the restaurant on a
    stretcher, leaving waiters and diners staring agape, while the maître
    d’ stood respectfully by the door with several of his staff.</p>

  <p>“Boy, was that guy ever <em>nuts</em>! Huh?” a wide-eyed young waiter
    would exclaim as he stood with the maître d’, gazing after the
    departing figures. But the latter would appear not to have heard.</p>

  <p>“The last of the <em>grand gourmets</em>,” he would sigh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span> and there was
    always a trace of wistful nostalgia in his face when he turned back
    from the door. “No, sir, they don’t make taste buds like <em>that</em>
    any more.”</p>

  <p>Connivance with the maître d’s of these top restaurants was an
    expensive affair, and there was a shake-up in more than one veteran
    staff due to it. Those who lost their jobs though were usually in a
    position to open fairly smart restaurants of their own—assuming, of
    course, they didn’t care to buy the one from which they were fired.</p>

  <p class="noindent">“In <em>literature</em>, of course,” Ginger Horton was saying, “the
    <em>best</em> writing comes out of the <em>heart</em>, and <em>not</em> the
    <em>head</em>!”</p>

  <p>“<em>I’ll</em> buy that!” agreed Guy Grand, coming forward on his big
    chair in ready interest, his voice going a bit taut with feeling as he
    continued:</p>

  <p>“For <em>my</em> money the best ... the <em>very best</em> darn writing is
    done right out of the old guts, by God!” And he gave his budding paunch
    a short slap to strengthen his meaning.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>

  <p>“Good Heavens,” said Esther crouching forward into a sea of giggles.</p>

  <p>“And <em>no rewrite</em>!” said Guy strongly, “... right out of the old
    guts onto the goddamn paper!”</p>

  <p>“Guy!” exclaimed Agnes, “really!” It was well known that Ginger Horton
    <em>did</em> write—wrote unceasingly—relentless torrents of a deeply
    introspective prose.</p>

  <p>“Sorry,” muttered Grand, sitting back again, “get a bit carried away
    sometimes, I expect.”</p>

  <p>“<em>Feeling and passion!</em>” agreed Ginger Horton in a shriek.
    “Of course most of the nasty little people around don’t feel a
    <em>thing</em>! <em>Not a single thing!</em>”</p>

  <p>“Interesting you should bring that up,” said Guy, reaching in his coat
    pocket and withdrawing a small memo-book, which he thumbed through as
    he continued:</p>

  <p>“Fellow I met on the train—I won’t mention his name if you don’t mind,
    because the thing is still pretty much on the drawing board, so to
    speak ... but I can tell you <em>this</em>: he’s one of the top-brass
    along ‘Publishers’ Row’—well, we got to talking, one thing and another,
    and he offered to let me in on a new scheme of his. How sound it is I
    <em>don’t</em> know, but he’s willing to let me in on the ground floor—at
    <em>second-story prices</em>, of course—” added Guy with a good-natured
    chuckle. “And <em>there’s</em> your old six-and-seven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span> again, but, still
    and all, that’s to be expected in the investment game. Well, his
    scheme—and I’d like to put out a feeler on it—is to issue a series of
    Do-It-Yourself Portables ... the <cite>Do-It-Yourself Shakespeare</cite>, the
    <cite>D.H. Do-It-Yourself Lawrence</cite>, and so on.”</p>

  <p>“What on earth—” Ginger began crossly.</p>

  <p>“<em>His</em> idea,” said Guy, “—and I don’t pretend to know how sound
    it is—is to issue the regular texts of well-known works, with certain
    words, images, bits of dialogue, and what have you, left <em>blank</em>
    ... just spaces there, you see ... which <em>the reader fills in</em>.”</p>

  <p>“Well, I never—” said Ginger irately.</p>

  <p>“Oh yes, here we are,” said Grand, evidently finding the place he was
    looking for in the memo-book, “Yes, now here’s some of his promotional
    copy ... rough draft, mind you ... let’s see, yes, this is for Kafka’s
    <cite>Do-It-Yourself Trial</cite>. Goes like this:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">‘Now you too can experience that same marvelous torment of
      ambiguity and haunting glimpse of eternal beauty which tore this
      strange artist’s soul apart and stalked him to his very grave!
      Complete with optional imagery selector, master word table and
      <em>writer’s-special</em> ball-point pen, thirty-five cents.’”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Ginger Horton made a gurgling sound of anger preparatory to speaking,
    but Guy was quick to press on:</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></p>

  <p>“And here we are for the <cite>Look Homeward (Yourself) Angel</cite>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">‘Hey there, reader-writer—how would you like to spew your entrails
      right out onto a priceless Sarouk carpet?!? Huh? Right in the
      middle of somebody’s living room with everyone watching? Huh? Well,
      by golly, you <em>can</em>, etcetera, etcetera.’</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>“As I say, it’s rough-draft copy, of course—needs tightening up,
    brightening up—but what’s your feeling on it, Ginger? Think it might
    spell ‘blast-off’ in the hearts of Mr. and Mrs. Front Porch?”</p>

  <p>“What? Well I wouldn’t put a ... a <em>single cent</em> into it!” said
    Ginger with considerable emphasis.</p>

  <p>“Oh it’s just too dreadful, Guy,” exclaimed Agnes. “You mustn’t.”</p>

  <p>“Hmm. I suppose you’re right,” said Guy, “... hard to say really.
    <em>Might</em> catch on—might not ... just wanted to put out a feeler or
    two on it. Always best to keep an open mind in the investment game.”</p>

  <p class="noindent">Grand had a bit of fun when he engaged a man to smash crackers with a
    sledge-hammer in Times Square.</p>

  <p>The stout fellow arrived with his gear—a box of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span> saltine crackers and
    a sixty-pound sledge—at precisely 9 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> and “set up shop,”
    as Guy expressed it, just outside the subway entrance on Forty-Second
    Street, the busiest thoroughfare in the world at this particular hour.</p>

  <p>Dressed in khaki and wearing a tin hat, the curious man forged his way
    through the deluge of people pouring out of the subway, and then in
    the very midst of the surging throng, opened the brass-studded pouch
    attached to his belt, extracted a single saltine cracker, and stooped
    over to place it carefully on the sidewalk.</p>

  <p>“Watch yourself!” he shouted as he stood up, gesturing impatiently.
    “Keep clear! Mind your step!” And then, raising the hammer to shoulder
    height, he brought it down in one horrendous blow on the cracker—not
    only smashing it to dust, but also producing several rather large
    cracks in the sidewalk.</p>

  <p>Within a few minutes the area was swollen with onlookers—all but the
    nearest of whom had to crane their heads wildly or leap up and down to
    get a glimpse of the man in the tin hat now as he squatted to examine
    the almost invisible dust of the cracker. “Sure mashed it, didn’t it?”
    he muttered, as to himself, in a professional manner.</p>

  <p>“What’d he say?” demanded several people urgently of those near the
    operation.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>

  <p>“Said it ‘sure <em>mashed</em> it,’” someone explained.</p>

  <p>“‘<em>Mashed</em> it’?” snorted another. “Boy, you can say <em>that</em>
    again!”</p>

  <p>Guy Grand was on the scene as well, observing the diverse comments and
    sometimes joining in.</p>

  <p>“Hey, how come you doin’ that?” he asked directly of the man in the tin
    hat.</p>

  <p>The man laid out another cracker, placing it with great care.</p>

  <p>“This?” he said, standing and raising the big sledge. “Oh, this is all
    technical.”</p>

  <p>“What’s he say?”</p>

  <p>“Says it’s technical.”</p>

  <p>“<em>What?</em>”</p>

  <p>“<em>Technical.</em>”</p>

  <p>“Yeah, well, what’s that he’s hitting with the hammer? What is that? It
    looks like a <em>cracker</em>.”</p>

  <p>“Naw, what’d he hit a <em>cracker</em> for—you kiddin’?”</p>

  <p>“Boy, look how that sledge busts up the sidewalk! Man, that’s some
    <em>sledge</em> he’s got there!”</p>

  <p>Within a very short time indeed, the gathering had spilled over into
    the street, interfering with the traffic there and causing the tough
    Forty-Second Street cop to wade growling into the heart of the crowd.
    “Okay, break it up!” he kept saying. “Shove off!” And when he reached
    the center where the operation was being carried out, he stood for a
    long while with his cap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span> pushed back on his head, hands on hips, and a
    nasty frown on his face, as he watched the man in the tin hat smash a
    few more crackers with the giant sledge.</p>

  <p>“Are you workin’ for the <em>city</em>, bud?” he finally asked in an
    irate voice.</p>

  <p>“That’s right,” said the tin-hat man without looking up. “City
    planning. This is technical.”</p>

  <p>“Yeah,” said the cop, “well, you sure picked a hell of a place to do
    it, that’s all I got to say.” Then, adjusting his cap, he started
    pushing at the crowd.</p>

  <p>“Okay, let’s keep movin’!” he shouted. “Break it up here! Get on to
    work! This is technical—<em>shove off!</em>”</p>

  <p>Diversion is at a premium at this hour however, and the crowd was not
    to be dispersed so easily. After a while the hoses had to be brought.
    When the ruse was discovered, Grand had a spot of bother clearing it.</p>

  <p class="noindent">“Perhaps Ginger could slip into one of your things,” suggested Guy.</p>

  <p>Esther childishly covered her mouth to hide a laugh, and darted glances
    of mischief and glee at the others, while Agnes drew in her breath
    before speaking:</p>

  <p>“I’m afraid we do <em>not</em> take the same size, Guy!”</p>

  <p>Agnes, thin as a whip, was perhaps a size nine; Ginger’s great size
    must have been well into the sixties.</p>

  <p>Ginger, too, shook her head emphatically.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

  <p>“Charles would simply die if I wore a frock he hadn’t done!” she said.</p>

  <p>“Has Charles done any chemises for you?” Guy inquired.</p>

  <p>“I <em>wanted</em> Charles to do some little Roman chemises for me,
    Guy,” Ginger confided. “I think I have the fullness for them—well, it
    would have meant giving up all my little feminine frills and laces, of
    course, and Charles simply would not hear of it! He said it would be a
    perfect <em>crime</em>—and he does so love to work with his laces, Guy, I
    simply didn’t have the heart! But then what’s your feeling on it, Guy?”
    she asked finally, giving a Carmenesque toss of her head.</p>

  <p>“Charles <em>could</em> be right, of course,” said Guy, after allowing it
    a moment’s thought.</p>

  <div class="center">*<span class="col3">*</span>
    <span class="col3">*</span><span class="col3">*</span><span class="col3">*</span></div>

  <p class="noindent">Grand gave a bit of a shock to the British white-hunters along the
    Congo (as well as to a couple of venerable old American writers who
    were there on safari at the time) when he turned up in a major hunting
    expedition with a 75-millimeter howitzer.</p>

  <p>“She throws a muzzle-velocity of twelve thousand f.p.s.,” Grand liked
    to quip. “She’ll stop anything on this continent.”</p>

  <p>Ordinarily used by the French Army as an artillery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span> fieldpiece, the big
    gun, stripped of all but its barrel, chamber, and firing mechanism,
    still weighed well over a hundred and fifty pounds.</p>

  <p>“She’ll stop anything that moves,” Guy would say, “—including a
    surfaced <em>whale</em>.”</p>

  <p>Grand had three natives carry the giant gun, while he, wearing a huge
    cushion-device around his stomach and a pith helmet so enormous that
    half his face was concealed beneath it, sauntered jauntily alongside,
    speaking knowledgeably to other members of the party about every aspect
    of firearms and big-game hunting.</p>

  <p>“A spot of bother in Kenya bush the other day,” he would say, “the big
    cat took two of our best boys.” Then he would give his monstrous weapon
    an affectionate pat and add knowingly, “—the cat changed her tune when
    she’d had a taste of the old seventy-five! Yessir, this baby carries a
    real <em>wallop</em>, you can bet your life on that!”</p>

  <p>About once an hour, Grand would stop and dramatically raise his hand,
    bringing the entire safari to a halt, while he and one of his trusty
    natives (heretofore known as the “best guide in Central Africa”) would
    sniff the air, nostrils flared and quivering, eyes a bit wild.</p>

  <p>“<em>There’s cat in the bush</em>,” Guy would say tersely, and while
    the rest of the party looked on in pure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span> amazement, Grand, big helmet
    completely obscuring his sight, would take up the huge gun and,
    staggering under its weight, brace it against the great cushion at his
    stomach, and blindly fire one of the mammoth shells into the bush,
    blasting a wide swath through the tall grass and felling trees as
    though they were stalks of corn. The recoil of the weapon would fling
    Grand about forty feet backwards through the air where he would land in
    a heap, apparently unconscious.</p>

  <p>“The baby packs a man-sized recoil,” Guy would say later. “The
    Mannlicher, of course, is nothing more than a <em>toy</em>.”</p>

  <p>Due to the extreme noise produced by the discharge of the 75, any
    actual game in the area was several miles away by the time the
    reverberations were stilled—so that these safaris would often go from
    start to finish without ever firing a shot, other than the occasional
    big boom from Grand’s 75.</p>

  <p>African hunting expeditions are serious and expensive affairs, and this
    kind of tomfoolery cost Grand a pretty penny. It did provide another
    amusing page for his memory book though—and the old native guides
    seemed to enjoy it as well.</p>

  <p class="noindent">“Hold on, here’s a bit of news,” said Guy then, suddenly brightening in
    his big chair and smartly slapping the newspaper spread across his lap.
    The banner read:</p>

  <div class="center">PRESIDENT ASKS NATION FOR FAITH<br>
    IN GIANT SPACE PROGRAM<br>
    Jackass Payload Promised</div>

  <p>He read it aloud in sonorous tones, but Ginger pooh-poohed the claim.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span></p>

  <p>“Probably one of these teeny-weeny Mexican burros!” she cried. “Jackass
    indeed!” She was a notorious foe of the administration.</p>

  <p>“I <em>wouldn’t</em> underestimate our Mister Uncle Sambo if I were you,”
    cautioned Guy, raising a rather arch look for Ginger and the others.</p>

  <p>“Why those Mexican burros are no bigger than a minute!” Ginger insisted.</p>

  <p>“Ginger’s right,” put in Agnes sharply, donning her spectacles—as she
    almost invariably did when taking political issue with Guy—to peer down
    at him then over the top of them, her face pinched and testy. “It would
    make a good deal more sense to send <em>that</em> great ninny up into
    space!” She flung back her head in a veritable cackle of delight at the
    idea. “I say blast that whole pack of ninnies right out into fartherest
    outer space!”</p>

  <p>Grand laid his paper aside.</p>

  <p>“I <em>don’t</em> think I’m an intolerant person,” he said quietly, but
    with considerable feeling, as he rose to his feet, “nor one of hasty
    opinion—but, in times like these, when the very <em>mettle</em> of this
    nation is in the crucible, I say that brand of talk is not far short
    of <em>damnable treason</em>!” Still glowering, he did a funny little
    two-step and ended in a smart salute. “I’m afraid I’ll not be staying
    for dinner myself, by the way,” he added matter-of-factly.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

  <p>“Guy, I simply will <em>not</em> hear of it!” cried cross Agnes,
    snatching her glasses from her nose and fixing the man with a terrible
    frown. “Surely you <em>shall</em> stay!”</p>

  <p>“Guy, Guy, Guy,” keened Esther, wagging her dear gray head, “always on
    the go.”</p>

  <p>“Yes, only wish I <em>could</em> stay,” agreed Guy sadly. “Best push on
    though—back to harness, back to grind.”</p>

  <div class="center">*<span class="col3">*</span>
    <span class="col3">*</span><span class="col3">*</span><span class="col3">*</span></div>

  <p class="noindent">It was along towards the end though that Grand achieved, in terms of
    public outrage, his <i lang="fr">succès d’estime</i>, as some chose to call it,
    when he put out to sea in his big ship, the <cite>S.S. Magic Christian</cite>
    ... the ship sometimes later referred to as “The Terrible Trick Ship
    of Captain Klaus.” Actually it was the old <cite>Griffin</cite>, a passenger
    liner which Grand bought and had reconditioned for about fifty million.</p>

  <p>A vessel of 30,000 tons, the <cite>Christian</cite> had formerly carried some
    eleven-hundred-odd passengers. Grand converted it into a one-class
    ship, outfitted to accommodate four hundred passengers, in a style and
    comfort perhaps unknown theretofore outside princely domains of the
    East. Each cabin on the <cite>Christian</cite> was a palace in miniature;
    the appointments were so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span> lavish and so exquisitely detailed that
    they might better be imagined than described. All the cabins were of
    course above deck and outside, each with a twenty-foot picture window
    and French doors to a private patio commanding a magnificent expanse
    of sea and sky. There were fine deep rugs throughout each suite and
    period-furnishings of first account, private bars, chaise longues,
    log-burning fireplaces, king-sized beds (canopy optional), an adjoining
    library-den (with a set of the <cite>Britannica</cite> and the best in smart
    fiction), tape recorders, powder rooms, small Roman bath and steam
    cabinet. Walls were generally in a quiet tone of suede with certain
    paneling of teak and rosewood.</p>

  <p>Ship’s dining room was styled after Maxim’s in Paris whose staff had
    been engaged to prepare the meals and to serve them with inconspicuous
    grace against a background of soft music provided by the Juilliard
    String Quartette. The balance of ship’s appointments were in harmonious
    key—there was, for example, a veritable jewel box of a theatre, seating
    just four hundred, fashioned in replica of the one in the Monte Carlo
    Casino; and the versatile repertory group, Old Vic Players, were on
    stand-by for two shows a day.</p>

  <p>Ship’s doctor, aside from being an able physician, was also a
    top-flight mental specialist, so that Problem-Counseling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span> was available
    to the passengers at all hours.</p>

  <p>But perhaps the most carefully thought-out nicety of the
    <cite>Christian</cite> was its principal lounge, the Marine Room—a large
    room, deep below decks, its wall (that which was part of ship’s hull)
    glassed so that the passengers sat looking out into the very heart of
    the sea. An ocean-floor effect was maintained by the regular release of
    deep-sea creatures from a water-line station near the bow, and through
    the use of powerful daylight kliegs there was afforded a breath-taking
    panorama—with giant octopi, huge rainbow-colored ray, serpents, great
    snowy angelfish, and fantastic schools of luminous tetra constantly
    gliding by or writhing in silent majestic combat a few feet from the
    relaxed passengers.</p>

  <p>Though the <cite>Magic Christian</cite> received its share of prevoyage
    hullabaloo (<cite>Life</cite> magazine devoted an issue to photographs,
    enthusiastically captioned), its only form of paid advertisement was
    a simple announcement of its sailing date, which appeared in <cite>The
    Times</cite> and in the <cite>National Geographic</cite>. The fare was not
    mentioned (though <cite>Life</cite> had said it was “about five thousand”)
    and the announcement was set in small heavy type, boxed with a very
    black border. “For the Gracious Few ...” it opened, and went on to
    state in a brief, restrained apology, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span> <em>not everyone</em> could
    be accepted, that applications for passage on the <cite>Christian</cite> were
    necessarily carefully screened, and that those who were refused should
    not take offense. “Our criteria,” it closed, “may <em>not</em> be yours.”</p>

  <p>Ship’s quarters were not shown until the applicant had been accepted,
    and then were shown by appointment.</p>

  <p>The ship was christened by the Queen of England.</p>

  <p>All of this had a certain appeal and the applications poured in. More
    than a few people, in fact, were <em>demanding</em> passage on the
    <cite>Christian</cite>’s first voyage. Those just back from holiday were
    suddenly planning to go abroad again; scores rushed home simply to
    qualify and make the trip. For many, the maiden voyage of the <cite>Magic
    Christian</cite> became a must.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Guy Grand, well in the background, was personally screening
    the applications according to some obscure criteria of his own, and
    apparently he had himself a few laughs in this connection. In the case
    of one application, for example, from a venerable scioness of Roman
    society, he simply scrawled moronically across it in blunt pencil: “Are
    <em>you</em> kidding?!? <em>No</em> wops!” The woman was said to have had
    a nervous breakdown and did later file for a million on defamation. It
    cost Grand a pretty to clear it.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, he accepted—or rather, engaged—as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span> passengers, a
    group from a fairly sordid freak show, most of whom could not be left
    untended, along with a few gypsies, Broadway types, and the like, of
    offensive appearance and doubtful character. These, however, were to
    be kept below decks for the first few days out, and, even so, numbered
    only about forty in all, so that a good nine-tenths of the passenger
    list, those on deck when the <cite>Christian</cite> set sail in such tasteful
    fanfare that Easter morn, were top-drawer gentry and no mistake.</p>

  <p>Unique among features of the <cite>Christian</cite> was its video
    communication system from the bridge to other parts of the ship. Above
    the fireplace in each cabin was a small TV screen and this provided
    direct visual communication with the Captain at the wheel and with
    whatever other activity was going on there, giving as it did a view
    of almost the entire bridge. These sets could be switched <em>on</em>
    or <em>off</em>, but the first day they were left <em>on</em> before the
    passengers arrived, in order to spare anyone the embarrassment of not
    knowing what the new gimmick was. So that when passengers entered their
    cabins now they saw at once, there on the screen above the fireplace:
    the Captain at the wheel. Captain Klaus. And for this person, Guy Grand
    had engaged a professional actor, a distinguished silver-haired man
    whose every gesture inspired the deepest confidence. He wore a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span> double
    row of service ribbons on his dark breast and deported himself in a
    manner both authoritative and pleasingly genial—as the passengers saw
    when he turned to face the screen, and this he did just as soon as they
    were all settled and under way.</p>

  <p>He was filling his pipe when he turned to camera, but he paused from
    this to smile and touch his cap in easy salute.</p>

  <p>“Cap’n Klaus,” he said, introducing himself with warm informality,
    though certainly at no sacrifice to his considerable bearing. “Glad to
    have you aboard.”</p>

  <p>He casually picked up a pointer stick and indicated a chart on the
    nearby wall.</p>

  <p>“Here’s our course,” he said, “nor’ by nor’east, forty-seven degrees.”</p>

  <p>Then he went on to explain the mechanics and layout of the bridge, the
    weather and tide conditions at present, their prospects, and so on,
    using just enough technical jargon throughout all this to show that he
    knew what he was about. He said that the automatic-pilot would be used
    from time to time, but that he personally preferred handling the wheel
    himself, adding good-humoredly that in his opinion “a ship favored men
    to machines.”</p>

  <p>“It may be an old-fashioned notion,” he said, with a wise twinkle, “...
    but to me, a ship is a woman.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

  <p>At last he gave a final welcome-salute, saying again: “Glad to have you
    aboard,” and turned back to his great wheel.</p>

  <p>This contact with the bridge and the fatherly Captain seemed to give
    the passengers an added sense of participation and security; and,
    indeed, things couldn’t have gone more smoothly for the first few hours.</p>

  <p>It was in the very early morning that something untoward occurred, at
    about three <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>—and of course almost everyone was asleep.
    They had watched their screens for a while: the Captain in the cozy
    bridge house, standing alone, pipe glowing, his strong eyes sweeping
    the black water ahead—then they had switched off their sets. There were
    a few people though who were still up and who had their sets on; and,
    of these few, there were perhaps three who happened to be watching the
    screen at a certain moment—when in the corner of the bridge house,
    near the door, there was a shadow, an odd movement ... then suddenly
    the appearance of a sinister-looking person, who crept up behind the
    Captain, hit him on the head, and seized the wheel as the screen
    blacked out.</p>

  <p>The people who had seen this were disturbed and, in fact, were soon
    rushing about, rousing others,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span> wanting to go to the bridge and so
    on. And they did actually get up a party and went to the bridge—only
    to be met at the top of the ladder by the Captain himself, unruffled,
    glossing it over, blandly assuring them that nothing was wrong, nothing
    at all, just a minor occurrence. And, of course, back in the cabins,
    there he was on the screen again, Captain Klaus, steady at the helm.</p>

  <p>Those three who had seen the outrage, being in such a hopeless
    minority, were thought to have been drunk or in some way out of
    their minds, and were gently referred to ship’s doctor, the mental
    specialist, so the incident passed without too much notice.</p>

  <p>And things went smoothly once more, until the next evening—when, in the
    exquisite gaming rooms just off the Marine Lounge, one of the roulette
    croupiers was seen, by several people, to be cheating ... darting his
    eyes about in a furtive manner and then interfering with the bets,
    snatching them up and stuffing them in his pocket, that sort of thing.</p>

  <p>It was such an unheard-of outrage that one old duke fainted dead away.
    The croupier was hustled out of the gaming room by Captain Klaus
    himself, who deplored the incident profusely and declared that the next
    dozen spins were on the house, losing bets to remain untouched for
    that time—gracious recompense, in the eyes of a sporting crowd, and
    applauded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span> as such; still, the incident was not one easily forgotten.</p>

  <p>Another curious thing occurred when some of the ladies went,
    individually, to visit the ship’s doctor. For the most part they had
    simply dropped around to pick up a few aspirin, sea-sickness pills—or
    merely to have a reassuring chat with the amiable physician. Several of
    these ladies, however, were informed that they looked “rather queer”
    and that an examination might be in order.</p>

  <p>“Better safe than sorry,” the doctor said, and then, during the
    examination, he invariably seemed to discover what he termed “a latent
    abrasion”—on the waist, side, hip, or shoulder of the woman—and though
    the abrasion could not be seen, the doctor deemed it required a
    compress.</p>

  <p>“Nothing serious,” he explained, “still it’s always wise to take
    precautions.” And so saying he would apply a <em>huge compress</em> to
    the area, a sort of gigantic Band-Aid about a foot wide and several
    inches thick, with big adhesive flaps that went halfway around the
    body. The tremendous bulk of these compresses was a nuisance, causing
    as they did, great deforming bulges beneath the women’s smart frocks.
    They were almost impossible to remove. One woman was seen running about
    with one on her head, like a big white hat.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span></p>

  <p>First lifeboat drill was scheduled for the following morning. Shortly
    before it, Captain Klaus came on the screen and smilingly apologized
    for the inconvenience and gave a leisurely and pleasantly informative
    talk about the drill and its necessity.</p>

  <p>“Better safe than sorry,” he said in a genial close to his little talk.</p>

  <p>When the drill signal sounded, they all got into life jackets—which
    were the latest thing and quite unlike standard passenger-ship
    equipment—and then, grumbling good-naturedly, they started for their
    boat stations; but an extraordinary thing happened: two minutes after
    they had put them on, the life jackets began inflating in a colossal
    way. Apparently the very act of donning the jacket set off some device
    which inflated it. The extraordinary thing was that each one blew up so
    big that it simply obscured the person wearing it, ballooning out about
    them, above their heads, below their feet, and to a diameter of perhaps
    twelve feet—so that if they were in an open space, such as their
    cabins, the lounge, or on deck, they simply rolled or lolled about on
    the floor, quite hidden from view, whereas if they were in a corridor,
    they were hopelessly stuck.</p>

  <p>In any event, almost no one escaped the effects of the faulty life
    jacket; so it was—after they deflated—with a good deal of annoyance
    that they came back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span> to the cabins, quite ready to hear Captain Klaus’
    explanation of what had gone amiss.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately though, the foghorn, which had been put to practice
    during the drill, was now evidently jammed. At any rate, it continued
    steadily during the Captain’s after-drill talk and completely shut out
    his voice, so that it was like looking at someone talk behind several
    layers of glass. The Captain himself didn’t seem to realize that he
    wasn’t coming through, and he went on talking for quite a while,
    punctuating his remarks with various little facial gestures to indicate
    a whole gamut of fairly intense feelings about whatever it was he was
    saying.</p>

  <p>The business with the foghorn was more serious than at first imagined;
    it continued, blasting without let-up, for the rest of the voyage.</p>

  <p>Quite incidental to what was happening during the drill, fifty crew
    members took advantage of the occasion to go around to the cabins,
    lounges, and dining rooms, and to substitute a thin length of balsa
    wood for one leg of every chair, table, and dresser on ship.</p>

  <p>When the Captain finished his lengthy and voiceless discourse, he
    smiled, gave an easy salute and left the bridge house. It was about
    this time that all the furniture began to collapse—in half an hour’s
    time there wasn’t one standing stick of it aboard the <cite>Christian</cite>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span></p>

  <p>Strange and unnatural persons began to appear—in the drawing rooms,
    salons, at the pool. During the afternoon tea dance, a gigantic
    <em>bearded-woman</em>, stark naked, rushed wildly about over the floor,
    interfering with the couples, and had to be forcibly removed by ship’s
    doctor.</p>

  <p>The plumbing went bad, too; and finally one of the <cite>Christian’s</cite>
    big stacks toppled—in such a way as to give directly on to ship’s
    dining room, sending oily smoke billowing through. And, in fact, from
    about this point on, the voyage was a veritable nightmare.</p>

  <p>Large curious posters were to be seen in various parts of the ship:</p>

  <div class="center">SUPPORT MENTAL HEALTH<br><br>
    LET’S KEEP THE CLAP OUT<br>
    OF CHAPPAQUIDDICK</div>

  <p class="noindent">as well as rude slogans, vaguely political, scrawled in huge misshapen
    letters across walls and decks alike:</p>

  <div class="center">DEATH TO RICH!<br>
    BLOW UP U.S.!</div>

  <p>Due to the strain of untoward events, more than one passenger sought
    solace and reassurance from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span> the problem-counselor, the ship’s
    distinguished doctor.</p>

  <p>“Doctor, what <em>in the name of God</em> is going on here!” the frenzied
    passenger would demand.</p>

  <p>The doctor would answer with a quizzical smile, arching his brows, only
    mildly censorious. “Fair-weather sailor?” he would gently chide, “...
    hmm? Cross and irritable the moment things aren’t going exactly to suit
    you? Now just what seems to be the trouble?”</p>

  <p>“<em>‘Trouble’!?!</em>” exclaimed the outraged passenger. “Good Lord,
    Doctor, surely you don’t think my complaint is an ... an unreasonable
    one?”</p>

  <p>The doctor would turn his gaze out to sea, thin fingers pressed beneath
    his chin in a delicate pyramid of contemplation, wistfully abstract for
    a moment before turning back to address the patient frankly.</p>

  <p>“Deep-rooted and unreasonable fears,” he would begin in a grand, rich
    voice, “are most often behind our anxieties ...” and he would continue
    in this vein until the passenger fairly exploded with impatience.</p>

  <p>“Great Scott, Doctor! I didn’t come here for a lecture on
    <em>psychology</em>—I came to find out what <em>in the name of Heaven</em>
    is going on <em>aboard this ship</em>!”</p>

  <p>In the face of these outbursts however, the doctor almost invariably
    retained his calm, regarding the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span> patient coolly, searchingly, making a
    few careful notes on his pad.</p>

  <p>“Now, you say that ‘the life jacket <em>over inflated</em>,’ and that
    you were ‘stuck in the corridor’—that was your expression, I believe,
    ‘<em>stuck in the corridor</em>’—and at that moment you felt a certain
    <em>malaise</em>, so to speak. Now, let me ask you <em>this</em>....” Or
    again, on other occasions, he might behave eccentrically, his head
    craned far to one side, regarding the patient out of the corners of his
    eyes, a sly, mad smile on his lips which moved in an inaudible whisper,
    almost a hiss.</p>

  <p>Finally, the patient, at the end of his tether, would leap to his feet.</p>

  <p>“Well, in the name of God, Doctor, the least you can do is let me have
    some <em>tranquillizers</em>!”</p>

  <p>But the doctor, as it turned out, was not one given to prescribing
    drugs promiscuously.</p>

  <p>“Escape into drugs?” he would ask, wagging his head slowly. “Mask our
    fears in an artificial fog?” And there was always a trace of sadness
    in his smile, as he continued, “No, I’m afraid the trouble is <em>in
    ourselves</em>, you see.” Then he would settle back expansively and
    speak with benign countenance. “Running away from problems is scarcely
    the solution to them. I <em>believe</em> you’ll thank me in years to
    come.” And at last he would lean forward in quiet confidence. “Do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
    you mind if I ask you a few questions about your ... your <em>early
    childhood</em>?”</p>

  <div class="center">*<span class="col3">*</span>
    <span class="col3">*</span><span class="col3">*</span><span class="col3">*</span></div>

  <p>When Captain Klaus next appeared on the screen, he looked as though
    he had been sleeping in two feet of water. Completely disheveled, his
    ribbons dangling in unsightly strands, his open coat flapping, his
    unknotted tie strung loosely around his collar, he seemed somewhat
    drunk as well. With a rude wave of his hand he dismissed bridge
    personnel and lurched toward the video screen, actually crashing into
    it, and remaining so close that his image was all distorted.</p>

  <p>“<em>We’ll get the old tub through!</em>” he was shouting at deafening
    volume, and at that moment he was attacked from behind by a ruffian
    type who was carrying a huge hypodermic and appeared to overpower the
    Captain and inject something into the top of his head, then to seize
    the wheel, wrenching it violently, before the screen went black.</p>

  <p>Also, it was learned about this time that because of fantastic
    miscalculation on the part of the ship’s-stores officer, the only food
    left aboard now was potatoes.</p>

  <p>Thus did the <cite>Christian</cite> roar over the sea, through fair weather
    and foul.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span></p>

  <p>Guy Grand was aboard of course, as a passenger, complaining bitterly,
    and in fact kept leading assault parties in an effort to find out, as
    he put it, “What the devil’s going on on the bridge!”</p>

  <p>But they were always driven back by a number of odd-looking men with
    guns and knives near the ladder.</p>

  <p>“Who the deuce are those chaps?” Grand would demand as he and the
    others beat a hasty retreat along the deck. “I don’t like the looks of
    this!”</p>

  <p>Occasionally the communications screen in each of the cabins would
    light up to reveal momentarily what was taking place on the bridge, and
    it was fairly incredible. The bridge house itself now was a swaying
    rubble heap and the Captain was seen intermittently, struggling with
    various assailants, and finally with what actually appeared to be a
    gorilla—the beast at last overpowering him and flinging him bodily out
    of the bridge house and, or so it seemed, into the sea itself, before
    seizing the wheel, which he seemed then to be trying to tear from its
    hub.</p>

  <p>It was about this time that the ship, which, as it developed, had
    turned completely around in the middle of the ocean, came back into New
    York harbor under full steam, and with horns and whistles screaming,
    ploughed headlong into the big Forty-Seventh Street pier.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span></p>

  <p>Fortunately no one was injured on the cruise; but, even so, it went
    far from easy with Grand—he had already sunk plenty into the project,
    and just how much it cost him to keep clear in the end, is practically
    anyone’s guess.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="noindent">“To speak seriously though,” said Guy Grand, “<em>does</em> anyone have
    news of Bill Thorndike? I haven’t had a word in the longest.”</p>

  <p>Ginger Horton set her cup down abruptly.</p>

  <p>“That ... that damn <em>nut</em>!” she said. “<em>No</em> and I
    <em>couldn’t</em> care less!”</p>

  <p>“Who?” asked Esther.</p>

  <p>“Dr. Thorndike,” explained Agnes, “that extraordinary dentist whom
    Ginger went to—he and Guy were friends at school together; isn’t that
    right, Guy?”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span></p>

  <p>“Yes, quite good friends too,” said Guy. “Poor fellow, had a nervous
    breakdown or something from what Ginger says. No, I haven’t had a
    word from him in the longest. How was he then, when you last saw him,
    Ginger?”</p>

  <p>Grand had made this inquiry any number of times, and then had always
    glossed over Ginger’s account of the incident, as though he could not
    fully take it in.</p>

  <p>“The <em>last time</em>!” she cried. “Why I only saw him once, of
    course—on <em>your</em> recommendation—and once too often it was too!
    Good God, don’t tell me you’ve forgotten <em>that</em> again? Why he was
    absolutely insane! He said to me, ‘These molars are soft, Mrs. Horton!’
    or some such ridiculous thing. ‘We’d better get you onto a soft-food
    regime right away!’ he said, and then, without another word about it,
    while I was still leaning back with my mouth open, he dropped a <em>raw
    egg</em> into my mouth and rushed out of the room, waving his arms and
    yelling at the top of his voice. Raving mad!”</p>

  <p>“Hmm—not like Bill Thorndike,” said Grand. “First-rate dentist, he used
    to be. You never went back to him then?”</p>

  <p>“I <em>certainly did not</em>! I went straight to the nearest police
    station, that’s where I went! And reported him!”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span></p>

  <p>Grand frowned a look of mild disapproval.</p>

  <p>“I’m afraid that won’t help Bill’s standing with the Association any.”</p>

  <p>“Well, I should hope <em>not</em>!” said Ginger Horton as strongly as she
    could.</p>

  <p>“How Uncle Edward used to love raw eggs!” said Esther. “Do you
    remember, Agnes?”</p>

  <p>“It’s hardly the same thing, Esther,” said Agnes.</p>

  <p>“Well, he always had them with a sort of sauce,” Esther recalled.
    “Worcestershire sauce, I suppose it was.”</p>

  <p>“It could have been some new form of deficiency treatment, of course,
    Ginger,” Agnes said. “I mean if your molars <em>were</em> soft....” But
    in the face of Ginger Horton’s mounting exasperation, she broke off and
    turned to Guy, “What do you think, Guy?”</p>

  <p>“Bill always <em>was</em> up-to-the-minute,” Guy agreed. “Always onto
    the latest. Very progressive in school affairs, that sort of thing—oh
    nothing disreputable of course—but, I mean to say, as far as being onto
    the latest in ... dentistry techniques, well I’m certainly confident
    that Bill—”</p>

  <p>“He just plopped that raw egg right into my mouth!” said Ginger
    shrilly. “Why I didn’t even know what it was! And that isn’t all—the
    instruments, and <em>everything</em> else there were crazy! There was
    some kind of wooden paddle....”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span></p>

  <p>“Spatula?” prompted Guy helpfully.</p>

  <p>“No, <em>not</em> a spatula! Good Heavens! A big wooden oar, about four
    feet long, actually leaning up against the chair.”</p>

  <p>“Surely he didn’t use that?” said Agnes.</p>

  <p>“But what on earth was it <em>doing</em> there is what I want to know?”
    Ginger demanded.</p>

  <p>“Maybe Bill’s taken up boating,” Guy offered but then coughed lightly
    to show the lameness of it, “... never cared for it though in school as
    I remember. <em>Tennis</em>, that was Bill’s game—damn good he was too;
    on the varsity his last two years.”</p>

  <p>“I simply <em>cannot</em> make you understand what an absolute madman he
    was,” said Ginger Horton. “There was something else on the chair too—a
    pair of <em>ice tongs</em> it looked like.”</p>

  <p>“Clamp, I suppose,” murmured Grand.</p>

  <p>“‘<em>Better safe than sorry, eh, Mrs. Horton?</em>’ he said to me like
    a perfect maniac, and then he said, ‘Now I <em>don’t</em> want you to
    swallow this!’ and he dropped a <em>raw egg</em> into my mouth, grabbed
    up a lot of those weird instruments and rushed around the room, waving
    them over his head, and then out the door, <em>yelling at the top of his
    lungs</em>!”</p>

  <p>“May have been called out on an emergency, you see,” said Guy, “happens
    all too often in that business from what I’ve seen of it.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span></p>

  <p>“What <em>was</em> he saying when he left, Ginger?” Agnes asked.</p>

  <p>“<em>Saying?</em> He wasn’t <em>saying</em> anything. He was simply
    yelling. ‘<em>Yaahh! Yaahh! Yaahh!</em>’ it sounded like.”</p>

  <p>“How extraordinary,” said Agnes.</p>

  <p>“<em>What</em> was he saying?” Esther asked of Agnes.</p>

  <p>“‘Yaahh, Yaahh,’” said Agnes quietly.</p>

  <p>“Not like Bill,” said Guy, shaking his head. “Must have been called out
    on emergency, only thing I can make of it.”</p>

  <p>“But surely the receptionist could have explained it all, my dear,”
    said Agnes.</p>

  <p>“There <em>was</em> no receptionist, I tell you!” said Ginger Horton
    irately. “There was no one but him—and a lot of fantastic instruments.
    And the chair was odd too! I’m lucky to have gotten out of there alive!”</p>

  <p>“Did she swallow the egg?” asked Esther.</p>

  <p>“Esther, for Heaven’s sake!”</p>

  <p>“What was that?” asked Grand, who seemed not to have heard.</p>

  <p>“Esther wanted to know if Ginger had <em>swallowed</em> the egg,” Agnes
    said.</p>

  <p>“Certainly not!” said Ginger. “I spit it right out. Not at first, of
    course; I was in a state of complete shock. ‘I <em>don’t</em> want you to
    swallow this!’ he said when he dropped it in, the maniac, so I just sat
    there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span> in a state of pure shock while he raced around and around the
    room, screaming like a perfect madman!”</p>

  <p>“Maybe it wasn’t an egg,” suggested Esther.</p>

  <p>“What on earth do you mean?” demanded Ginger, quite beside herself.
    “It certainly <em>was</em> an egg—a raw egg! I <em>tasted</em> it and
    <em>saw</em> it, and some of the yellow got on my frock!”</p>

  <p>“And then you filed a complaint with the authorities?” asked Agnes.</p>

  <p>“Good Heavens, Agnes, I went straight to the police. Well, he could not
    be found! Disappeared without trace. Raving mad!”</p>

  <p>“Bill Thorndike’s no fool,” said Grand loyally, “I’d stake my word on
    that.”</p>

  <p>“But <em>why</em> did he disappear like that, Guy?” asked Agnes.</p>

  <p>“May have moved his offices to another part of the city, you see,” Guy
    explained, “or out of the city altogether. I know Bill was awfully
    keen for the West Coast, as a matter of fact; couldn’t get enough of
    California! Went out there every chance he could.”</p>

  <p>“<em>No</em>, he is not <em>anywhere</em> in this country,” said
    Ginger Horton with considerable authority. “There is absolutely no
    <em>trace</em> of him.”</p>

  <p>“Don’t tell me Bill’s chucked the whole thing,” said Grand
    reflectively, “given it all up and gone off to Bermuda or somewhere.”
    He gave a soft tolerant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span> chuckle. “Wouldn’t surprise me too much though
    at that. I know Bill was awfully fond of <em>fishing</em> too, come
    to think of it. Yes, fishing and tennis—that was Bill Thorndike all right.”</p>

  <p class="noindent">“But you just <em>cannot</em> go off like that, Guy,” said Agnes, truly
    impatient with the boy now when he rose to leave. “Surely you shan’t!”</p>

  <p>“<em>Can</em> and <em>must</em>, my dears,” Guy explained, kissing
    them both. “Flux, motion, growth, change—those are your great life
    principles. Best keep pace while we can.”</p>

  <p>He bent forward and took fat Ginger’s hand in his own. “Yes, I’ll be
    moving on, Ginger,” he said with a warm smile for her, expansive now,
    perhaps in anticipation, “pushing down to Canaveral and out Los Alamos
    way!”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span></p>

  <p>“Good Heavens,” said Agnes, “in this dreadful heat? How silly!”</p>

  <p>“Always on the go,” purred Esther.</p>

  <p>“It’s wise to keep abreast,” said Guy seriously. “I’ll just nip down to
    Canaveral and see what’s shaking on the space-scene, so to speak.”</p>

  <p>“Same old six-and-seven, Guy?” teased big Ginger, flashing up at him.</p>

  <p>“Well, who can say?” admitted Guy frankly. “These are odd times—are,
    if I may say, times that try men’s souls. Yet each of us does his

  <p>“Guy,” said Ginger, squeezing his hand and sparkling up again on one
    monstrous surge of personality, “it <em>has</em> been fun!” Good-byes
    were her forte.</p>

  <p>Guy gave a courtly nod, before turning to go, in deference, it seemed,
    to her beauty.</p>

  <p>“My dear,” he whispered, with a huskiness that made all the ladies
    tingle, “it has been ... <em>inspiring</em>.”</p>

  <p class="noindent">The S.S. <cite>Magic Christian</cite> was Grand’s last major project—at least
    it was the last to be brought into open account. After that he began
    to taper off. However, he did like “keeping in touch,” as he expressed
    it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span> and, for one thing, he bought himself a grocery store in New York
    City. Quite small, it was more or less indistinguishable from the
    several others in the neighborhood, and Grand put up a little sign in
    the window.</p>

  <div class="center"><i>New Owner—New Policy<br>
    Big Get-Acquainted Sale</i></div>

  <p>Grand was behind the counter himself, wearing a sort of white smock—not
    too unlike his big Vanity lab smock—when the store opened that evening.</p>

  <p>His first customer was a man who lived next door to the store. He
    bought a carton of Grape-Ade.</p>

  <p>“That will be three cents,” said Grand.</p>

  <p>“<em>How much?</em>” asked the man, with a frown.</p>

  <p>“Three cents.”</p>

  <p>“Three <em>cents</em>? For six Grape-Ade? Are you kidding?”</p>

  <p>“It’s our two-for-one Get-Acquainted on Grape-Ade,” said Grand. “It’s
    new policy.”</p>

  <p>“Boy, <em>I’ll</em> say it’s new,” said the man. “And how! Three
    <em>cents</em>? Okay by me, brother!” He slapped three cents on the
    counter. “There it is!” he said and still seemed amazed when Grand
    pushed the carton towards him.</p>

  <p>“Call again,” said Grand.</p>

  <p>“That’s some policy all right,” said the man, looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span> back over his
    shoulder as he started for the door. At the door, however, he paused.</p>

  <p>“Listen,” he said, “do you sell it ... uh, you know, by the
    <em>case</em>?”</p>

  <p>“Well, yes,” said Grand, “you would get some further reduction if you
    bought it by the case—not too much, of course; we’re working on a
    fairly small profit-margin during the sale, you see and—”</p>

  <p>“Oh, I’ll pay the two-for-one all right. Christ! I just wanted to know
    if I could <em>get</em> a case at that price.”</p>

  <p>“Certainly, would you like a case?”</p>

  <p>“Well, as a matter of fact, I could <em>use</em> more than one case....”</p>

  <p>“How many cases could you use?”</p>

  <p>“Well, uh ... how many ... how many have you <em>got</em>?”</p>

  <p>“Could you use a thousand?”</p>

  <p>“A <em>thousand?!?</em> A thousand cases of Grape-Ade?”</p>

  <p>“Yes, I could give you ... say, ten percent off on a thousand ... and
    at twenty-four bottles to the case, twelve cents a case ... would be
    one hundred and twenty dollars, minus ten percent, would be one hundred
    and eight ... call it one-naught-five, shall we?”</p>

  <p>“<em>No, no.</em> I couldn’t use a thousand cases. Jesus! I meant, say,
    <em>ten</em> cases.”</p>

  <p>“That would be a dollar twenty.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span></p>

  <p>“Right!” said the man. He slapped down a dollar twenty on the counter.
    “Boy, that’s some policy you’ve got there!” he said.</p>

  <p>“It’s our Get-Acquainted policy,” said Grand.</p>

  <p>“It’s some policy all right,” said the man. “Have you got any other ...
    <em>specials</em> on? You know, ‘two-for-one,’ that sort of thing?”</p>

  <p>“Well, most of our items have been reduced for the Get-Acquainted.”</p>

  <p>The man hadn’t noticed it before, but price tags were in evidence, and
    all prices had been sharply cut: milk, two cents a quart—butter, ten
    cents a pound—eggs, eleven cents a dozen—and so on.</p>

  <p>The man looked wildly about him.</p>

  <p>“How about cigarettes?”</p>

  <p>“No, we decided we wouldn’t carry cigarettes; since they’ve been
    linked, rather authoritatively, to cancer of the lung, we thought
    it wouldn’t be exactly in the best of taste to sell them—being a
    <em>neighborhood</em> grocery, I mean to say.”</p>

  <p>“Uh-huh, well—listen, I’m just going home for a minute now to get a
    sack, or a ... trunk, or maybe a truck ... I’ll be right back ...”</p>

  <p>Somehow the word spread through the neighborhood and in two hours the
    store was clean as a whistle.</p>

  <p>The next day, a sign was on the empty store:</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span></p>

  <div class="center">MOVED TO NEW LOCATION</div>

  <p>And that evening, in another part of town, the same thing
    occurred—followed again by a quick change of location. The people who
    had experienced the phenomenon began to spend a good deal of their
    time each evening looking for the new location. And occasionally now,
    two such people meet—one who was at the big Get-Acquainted on West
    4th Street, for example, and the other at the one on 139th—and so,
    presumably, they surmise not only that it wasn’t a dream, but that it’s
    still going on.</p>

  <p>And some say it does, in fact, still go on—they say it accounts for the
    strange searching haste which can be seen in the faces, and especially
    the eyes, of people in the cities, every evening, just about the time
    now it starts really getting dark.</p>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
